## 4B. ADDITIONAL KEY FIGURES — Gap Priority Expansion

### 4B.1 Leslie Kean — Investigative Journalist (Tier 1–2)

- **Source:** Kean, Leslie. *UFOs: Generals, Pilots, and Government Officials Go on the Record*. Crown, 2010; Kean, Cooper & Blumenthal, NYT (2017); Kean & Blumenthal, *The Debrief* (2023).
- **Credentials:** Investigative journalist; co-authored the Dec 16, 2017 *New York Times* article that revealed the existence of AATIP ("Glowing Auras and ‘Black Money’") — the single most consequential UAP journalism event in decades
- Co-broke the David Grusch story (*The Debrief*, June 5, 2023) alongside Ralph Blumenthal
- **Book** (*UFOs*, 2010): Compiled testimony from international military officials and pilots; introduced many credible military witnesses to public discourse
- **Assessment:** TIER 1–2 for journalistic rigor. Kean is perhaps the most consequential individual in modern UAP disclosure after Grusch and Elizondo. No claims of personal UAP experience — strictly a reporter.

### 4B.2 Lt. Cmdr. Alex Dietrich, USN — Tic Tac Witness (Tier 2)

- **Source:** Dietrich interviews on *60 Minutes* (2021), *Unidentified* (2019), multiple podcast appearances.
- Fravor's wingman (WSO/pilot, second F/A-18F) during the Nov 14, 2004 Nimitz Tic Tac encounter
- Independently corroborates Fravor's account: visual on a white, tic-tac-shaped object performing erratic maneuvers over a disturbance in the water
- Initially reluctant to speak publicly; came forward after the 2017 NYT revelations
- Has spoken about the career risk and stigma of reporting UAP
- **Assessment:** TIER 2 — active-duty military, corroborating witness to the strongest UAP case in the database. Her testimony strengthens Fravor's account from "one pilot" to "two aircraft, multiple crew."

### 4B.3 Dr. Colm Kelleher — BAASS/AAWSAP Program Manager (Tier 2)

- **Source:** Kelleher & Knapp, *Hunt for the Skinwalker* (2005); Lacatski, Kelleher & Knapp, *Skinwalkers at the Pentagon* (2021).
- Biochemist; former deputy administrator of BAASS (Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies)
- Managed day-to-day operations of AAWSAP ($22M DIA program) under James Lacatski
- Co-authored two key books documenting AAWSAP's operations and Skinwalker Ranch investigations
- Served as the bridge between Bigelow's private research (NIDS, 1995–2004) and government-funded investigation (AAWSAP, 2008–2012)
- **Assessment:** TIER 2 — institutional program manager with published accounts. Not a direct UAP witness but key institutional figure.

### 4B.4 James Lacatski — DIA AAWSAP Program Manager (Tier 2)

- **Source:** Lacatski, Kelleher & Knapp, *Inside the U.S. Government Covert UFO Program* (2023); Lacatski et al., *Skinwalkers at the Pentagon* (2021).
- Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) rocket scientist who conceived and managed AAWSAP
- Claims to have personally witnessed an anomalous event at Skinwalker Ranch that catalyzed the DIA program
- **2023 book** (*Inside the U.S. Government Covert UFO Program*) reveals that AAWSAP's mandate was broader than just UAP — it studied "all anomalous phenomena" including poltergeist activity, consciousness effects, and biological impacts
- **Assessment:** TIER 2 — the only named DIA official who managed the program. His books are primary sources for AAWSAP's actual scope (broader than publicly understood).

### 4B.5 Diana Walsh Pasulka — Religious Studies Professor (Tier 2)

- **Source:** Pasulka, D.W. *American Cosmic: UFOs, Religion, Technology*. Oxford UP, 2019; Pasulka, D.W. *Encounters*. St. Martin's, 2023.
- Professor of Religious Studies, University of North Carolina at Wilmington
- **Key contribution:** Documents how prominent scientists and tech figures (anonymous in her accounts) privately study UAP materials and phenomena while maintaining public silence due to stigma
- Argues that UAP belief systems function as an emerging "new religion" with its own prophets (contactees), sacred sites (crash locations), and relics (materials/fragments)
- Her framework provides the sociology-of-science lens that the UAP field otherwise lacks
- **Assessment:** TIER 2 for her academic framework (published by Oxford UP). She does not make UAP claims herself; she studies the belief systems and institutional behavior surrounding them.

### 4B.6 Avi Loeb — Harvard Astrophysicist (Tier 2)

- **Source:** Loeb, Avi. *Extraterrestrial: The First Sign of Intelligent Life Beyond Earth*. Houghton Mifflin, 2021; Galileo Project publications; Loeb et al., IM1 expedition papers (2023–).
- Frank B. Baird Jr. Professor of Science, Harvard University; former chair of Harvard Astronomy Dept.
- **‘Oumuamua (2017):** Proposed interstellar object 1I/‘Oumuamua might be an artifact of alien technology (lightsail) based on its anomalous acceleration. Most astronomers disagree (hydrogen outgassing hypothesis — Bergner & Darryl Seligman 2023).
- **Galileo Project (2021–):** Harvard-based initiative for systematic, scientific UAP detection using calibrated multi-sensor observatories. The most prominent academic UAP research program.
- **IM1 Expedition (2023):** Led ocean floor recovery of metallic spherules along the trajectory of interstellar meteor CNEOS 2014-01-08 near Papua New Guinea. Claimed anomalous isotopic composition. Intense peer criticism: Desch et al. argued spherules are likely industrial contamination from nearby WWII-era ship wreck.
- **Assessment:** TIER 2 — Loeb's credentials are undeniable (Harvard chair). His UAP/interstellar claims are controversial within the astrophysics community. The Galileo Project's methodology is sound; the IM1 spherule claims are disputed.
- **Cross-References:** I07 (IM1 ocean recovery connects to USO/ocean investigation)

### 4B.7 Notable International Figures (Brief Profiles)

- **Paul Hellyer (Canada, 1923–2021):** Former Minister of National Defence (1963–67); in 2005 publicly stated governments have been in contact with alien civilizations. One of the highest-ranking officials worldwide to make such claims. **Tier 3** (extraordinary claims, no supporting evidence presented).
- **Haim Eshed (Israel):** Former head of the Israeli Defense Ministry Space Directorate (30-year tenure); claimed in 2020 interview (Yediot Aharonot) that a "Galactic Federation" exists and the U.S. and Israel have agreements with extraterrestrials. **Tier 3–4** (credentials real, claims extraordinary and unsupported).
- **Ross Coulthart (Australia):** Investigative journalist; *In Plain Sight* (2021). Has broken multiple UAP stories and conducted notable interviews (Grusch, alleged insiders). Increasingly prominent in UAP journalism. **Tier 2 for journalistic work.**

---

## 5. DEBUNKING NOTES

- **Lazar:** MIT has NO record of enrollment. The "Department of Naval Intelligence" on his W-2 is an entity that doesn't exist (the correct name is Office of Naval Intelligence). These are basic factual problems.
- **Elizondo:** Some DoD officials stated he had "no responsibilities" regarding AATIP. Others confirmed involvement. The truth may involve compartmentalization and informal roles.
- **Grusch:** "Urgent and credible" is an ICIG procedural determination about the complainant's standing, NOT a finding that his claims are factually true. This distinction is critical.
- **All claimants:** No whistleblower has produced a physical artifact, document with verifiable classification markings, or reproducible evidence that can be independently tested.

## 7. [RECENT] 2024–2026 Oversight Addendum

### 7.1 Hearing Continuity and Witness Risk Profile

- Public follow-on hearing activity through 2024 sustains relevance of prior whistleblower testimony ecosystems.
- Core unresolved pattern remains: high-credibility personnel making process claims without parallel public release of adjudicating classified evidence.

### 7.2 AARO/Public Intake Clarification (Tier 1)

- AARO FAQ indicates public direct reporting remains pending while military reporting is channelized via command and FAA pathways.
- This narrows near-term expectations for civilian-origin firsthand classified-adjacent testimony entering official pipeline quickly.

### 7.3 Interpretation Constraint

- I06 evidentiary center of gravity remains process/signal-level (institutional response, credibility, and consistency), not material proof.
- Maintain strict claim taxonomy: allegation, corroborative process signal, documentary evidence, physically testable evidence.

### 7.4 2025 Whistleblower Protection and Legislative Action
- **Congressional Whistleblower Protection Act of 2025 (S.1154):** Recent legislative efforts have aimed to bolster protections for individuals disclosing UAP-related information to Congress. This proposed act seeks to extend protections to federal employees, including those within the intelligence community and federal contractors, who report misconduct or hidden programs.
- **UAP Disclosure Act of 2025:** Introduced by Rep. Eric Burlison (August 2025), this act is designed to preserve government records on UAP and establish an independent board to review and declassify material, directly responding to the claims made by whistleblowers like David Grusch.
- **Emerging Witnesses (Late 2025):** Reports indicate new whistleblowers are working privately with the Congressional UAP Caucus, leading to demands for secure SCIF briefings (e.g., Rep. Mace requesting briefings with Sen. Rubio). This suggests the pipeline of high-level intelligence and military personnel coming forward to Congress remains active, even if their testimony is not yet public.

## 9. SWEEP FINDINGS — Gap Priority Additions (Feb 2026)

> **Note:** The following sections were added during the Section I Sweep (Feb 2026). Per Add-Only Change Policy, existing content is preserved.

### 9.1 Missing Key Figure Profiles

#### 18. Dr. Eric W. Davis — Physicist / DIRD Author / Congressional Briefer

- **Background:** PhD physics (University of Arizona); Senior Research Physicist at Institute for Advanced Studies at Austin (IASA) / EarthTech International; formerly with National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS)
- **Credentials:** Author of multiple peer-reviewed papers on advanced propulsion, wormhole physics, and vacuum energy; co-editor of *Frontiers of Propulsion Science* (AIAA, 2009) with Marc Millis
- **Key Roles:**
  - Co-authored multiple AAWSAP DIRDs (Defense Intelligence Reference Documents) on warp drives, wormholes, and advanced propulsion
  - Subject of the leaked Wilson-Davis memo (2002, leaked 2019) — alleged notes from a meeting with RADM Thomas Wilson (DIA Director) in which Wilson described being denied access to a SAP involving recovered UAP material
  - **NYT (July 23, 2020):** Ralph Blumenthal and Leslie Kean reported that Davis "briefed a Defense Department agency as recently as March about retrievals from 'off-world vehicles not made on this earth'"
  - Has briefed Congressional committees on crash retrieval allegations
- **Assessment:** Davis is arguably the MOST CONSEQUENTIAL physicist in the crash retrieval narrative, bridging theoretical physics (warp drives, wormholes), government programs (AAWSAP DIRDs), classified briefings (Congressional), and the Wilson-Davis memo. His absence from I06 until this sweep was the section's most significant gap.
- **Tier:** T2 — Credentials and institutional roles are verified; specific claims about recovered materials remain unverified publicly
- **Why missing previously:** Davis maintains a relatively low public profile compared to Elizondo, Grusch, or Fravor. His significance is in institutional access rather than public testimony.
- **Cross-Refs:** I01 (Wilson-Davis memo), I03 (DIRDs, propulsion physics), I05 (crash retrieval programs)

#### 19. George Knapp — Investigative Journalist

- **Background:** Peabody Award-winning journalist; KLAS-TV (Las Vegas) chief investigative reporter for 30+ years
- **Key Roles:**
  - Broke the Bob Lazar story (1989) — first journalist to give Lazar a public platform, introducing Area 51/S-4 to mainstream awareness
  - Investigated Skinwalker Ranch extensively; co-authored *Hunt for the Skinwalker* (2005) and *Skinwalkers at the Pentagon* (2021) with Colm Kelleher
  - Investigated the Needles, CA crash case (2008)
  - Co-authored *Inside the U.S. Government Covert UFO Program* (2023) with Lacatski and Kelleher — the definitive AAWSAP history
  - Instrumental in connecting Bigelow Aerospace to DIA for the AAWSAP contract
- **Significance:** Knapp's journalistic role is comparable to Leslie Kean's — both are non-researchers whose investigative work shaped the disclosure trajectory. Knapp's beat has been longer (1989–present) and more focused on the Bigelow/Skinwalker/AAWSAP thread.
- **Tier:** T2 for journalistic output — no personal UAP claims; role is investigative
- **Cross-Refs:** I01 (AAWSAP), I05 (Needles, Lazar), I06 (Lazar profile)

#### 20. Tom DeLonge — TTSA Founder

- **Background:** Former Blink-182 guitarist; founded To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science (2017)
- **Key Roles:**
  - Assembled the team that enabled the 2017 NYT disclosure: recruited Elizondo, Mellon, Puthoff, Jim Semivan (CIA ret.), Chris Mellon
  - TTSA facilitated the release of GIMBAL, GOFAST, and FLIR1 videos to the public
  - Published *Sekret Machines* series (fiction/non-fiction) with Peter Levenda, claiming insider knowledge
  - Received WikiLeaks-published emails showing contact with USAF Gen. William McCasland and other officials about UAP topics
- **Credibility Issues:**
  - Rock musician background invites dismissal; however, the TEAM he assembled had undeniable credentials
  - TTSA pivoted heavily toward entertainment/media after key members (Elizondo, Mellon) departed
  - Some specific claims in *Sekret Machines* are unverifiable
- **Significance:** DeLonge is historically important as the CATALYST who brought Elizondo, Mellon, and Puthoff together into a public-facing organization. Without TTSA, the 2017 NYT story may not have happened.
- **Tier:** T2 for TTSA's institutional role in video release; T3 for personal knowledge claims
- **Cross-Refs:** I01, I03 (TTSA materials)

#### 21. Robert Salas — Malmstrom AFB Missile Commander

- **Background:** Former USAF Captain; deputy missile combat crew commander, Malmstrom AFB
- **Key Claims:** Directly involved in the March 1967 Oscar Flight ICBM shutdown; received real-time reports from topside security of a glowing red object while underground in the launch control center
- **Public Advocacy:**
  - National Press Club conference (Sep 27, 2010) with Robert Hastings — one of 7 former USAF officers to publicly testify
  - Author of *Faded Giant* (2005) and co-author of *Unidentified: The UFO Phenomenon* (2014)
  - Has testified to Congressional staff regarding nuclear-UAP events
- **Significance:** Salas is the PRIMARY witness for the most consequential nuclear-UAP event in the database (Malmstrom ICBM shutdowns). His absence from I06 was a gap given his prominence in I04.
- **Tier:** T2 — Military credentials verified; event documentation exists in USAF records; UAP causation disputed
- **Cross-Refs:** I04 (Malmstrom cases)

#### 22. Michael Herrera — USMC Veteran (Tier 3)

- **Background:** Former U.S. Marine Corps infantry; deployed to Indonesia
- **Key Claims:** At the National Press Club (June 12, 2023, Disclosure Project event), claimed he witnessed a massive ~300 ft craft and a military retrieval operation in Indonesia in 2009
  - Described an encounter during a humanitarian mission following the 2009 Sumatra earthquake
  - Claimed armed military personnel threatened his unit to maintain silence
- **Credibility Issues:**
  - Single-unit witness testimony; no independent corroboration
  - Specific details (exact location, commanding officers) not independently verified
  - Appeared at Steven Greer's Disclosure Project event — Greer's events have included witnesses with varying credibility levels
- **Assessment:** TIER 3 — Military service is verifiable; specific encounter claims are unverified. Included because his testimony was made publicly and under real personal risk.
- **Cross-Refs:** I05

### 9.2 Missing Counter-Arguments

#### 9.2.1 Appeal to Authority Fallacy

- **Structural critique applicable to all of I06:**
- High credentials (Harvard chair, Stanford professor, DIA director, Navy pilot) do not automatically validate extraordinary claims
- A general's rank doesn't make UAP testimony more reliable than their SPECIFIC EXPERTISE warrants
- Credentials establish that a person held a position — not that their interpretation of anomalous events is correct
- **Counter:** Credentials DO establish access. A DIA official has access to classified information that outsiders do not. The question is whether the person accurately represents what they accessed.

#### 9.2.2 Witness Contamination / Echo Chamber Effect

- Many key figures in I06 know each other, attend the same conferences, are briefed by the same people, and appear on the same media programs
- This creates potential for unconscious confirmation bias and narrative convergence
- **Example:** Elizondo, Mellon, Puthoff, and Davis were all connected through TTSA, AAWSAP, or both. Their claims may converge because they share information, not because they independently discovered the same facts.
- **Counter:** Independent verification structures exist — Grusch filed through ICIG independently; Fravor's encounter has multi-sensor corroboration

### 9.3 Tier Adjustments

| Figure | Current Tier | Adjusted Tier | Reason |
|--------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Haim Eshed | T3–T4 | T4 | "Galactic Federation" claims with zero supporting evidence; credentials alone insufficient |
| Phil Schneider | T4 | T4 (confirmed) | No verifiable evidence; debunking evidence strong |
