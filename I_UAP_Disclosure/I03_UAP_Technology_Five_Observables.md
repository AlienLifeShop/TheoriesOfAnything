## QUICK SUMMARY

This section consolidates current open-source evidence around alleged advanced UAP performance. The strongest confirmed layer is institutional: patents exist, hearings occurred, and agencies published analyses. The weakest layer remains engineering proof: no public, reproducible demonstration confirms breakthrough propulsion. AARO and NASA materials provide significant counterweights (parallax, satellite flaring, ordinary alloy findings, no confirmed extraterrestrial evidence).

## 1. Documentation Findings (I03-F01 to I03-F10)

### I03-F01 — Alcubierre metric is valid theory, not demonstrated propulsion
- **Finding:** Warp-metric spacetime engineering is established in theoretical GR literature but remains far from validated aerospace implementation.
- **Sources:** Alcubierre 1994 records (arXiv/ADS metadata and journal indexing).
- **Tier:** `T2`
- **Status:** `Confirmed (theoretical framework only)`

### I03-F02 — “Five Observables” is a useful field heuristic, not a formal official scientific standard
- **Finding:** The framework is widely used in disclosure-era discourse to classify anomaly traits, but no official physics standard publicly validates it as a model.
- **Sources:** Congressional testimony ecosystem and published discussion context.
- **Tier:** `T2–T3`
- **Status:** `Partially Confirmed`

### I03-F03 — Sworn congressional testimony repeatedly claims extraordinary kinematics

- **Sources:** Congress.gov hearing transcript.
- **Tier:** `T1` for testimony existence; `T3` for mechanism claim.
- **Status:** `Confirmed as testimony`

### I03-F04 — Navy-assigned Pais patents are authentic records
- **Finding:** US10144532B2, US10135366B2, and US10322827B2 exist, were assigned to the Department of the Navy, and contain advanced propulsion/field claims.
- **Sources:** Patent records and legal event logs.
- **Tier:** `T1`

## 3. Connections to Historical Material

- Pattern-level overlap exists between ancient luminous-sky narratives and modern anomalous-motion reports.
- This is a **descriptive continuity**, not proof of shared mechanism/origin.
- Useful bridge: treat ancient texts as phenomenological records and modern data as instrument-constrained event records.

---

## 4. Gaps Remaining

- No publicly reproducible hardware demonstration validating extraordinary propulsion claims.
- Limited release of raw multi-sensor datasets (radar + IR + telemetry + calibration).
- Public clips are often short/context-limited.
- No cross-agency public technical standard defining threshold criteria for “extraordinary” UAP kinematics.

---

## 5. Debunking / Counterweight

- AARO parallax and Starlink papers plausibly explain a subset of reports.
- AARO/ORNL specimen work undercuts “exotic material” claims in tested cases.
- NASA reports no evidence that UAP are extraterrestrial.
- Patent existence is not equivalent to engineering validation.

## 5B. RECENT THEORETICAL PHYSICS & CONSCIOUSNESS-UAP NEXUS — Gap Priority Expansion

### 5B.1 Positive-Energy Warp Drives (2021+) — Tier 2–3

- **Source:** Lentz, Erik. "Breaking the Warp Barrier: Hyper-Fast Solitons in Einstein-Maxwell-Plasma Theory." *Classical and Quantum Gravity* 38(7), 2021; Bobrick, Alexey & Gianni Martire. "Introducing Physical Warp Drives." *Classical and Quantum Gravity* 38(10), 2021.
- **Lentz (2021) — Positive-energy soliton warp drive:**
  - The original Alcubierre metric requires **negative energy density** (exotic matter) — not known to exist in macroscopic quantities
  - Lentz demonstrated soliton solutions to Einstein's field equations achieving superluminal-equivalent travel using ONLY positive energy densities
  - **Implication:** Eliminates the single biggest objection to warp-drive physics
  - **Caveat:** Energy requirements remain enormous (~mass-energy of Jupiter for a 10m craft). Mathematically valid but not engineeringly feasible.
- **Bobrick & Martire (2021) — Warp drive classification:**
  - General framework classifying ALL possible warp drive spacetimes
  - Subluminal warp solutions constructible with known physics/positive energy
- **White (NASA Eagleworks) — Experimental warp detection:**
  - Harold "Sonny" White at NASA JSC attempted to detect micro-scale spacetime distortion via White-Juday interferometer
  - Results: inconclusive/disputed. The ONLY attempt at experimental warp-field detection.
- **Assessment:** Post-Alcubierre theoretical progress is REAL and published in mainstream physics journals. Energy requirements remain prohibitive. **Tier 2 for physics; Tier 3 for practical feasibility.**

### 5B.2 Consciousness-UAP Interface Hypothesis — Tier 3

- **Sources:** Elizondo, *Imminent* (2024); Nolan, Garry P. (interviews); Vallée, *Messengers of Deception* (1979); Pasulka, *American Cosmic* (2019).
- An emerging research thread posits UAP phenomena may have a consciousness dimension — not purely physical objects but interacting with/mediated by human consciousness.
- **Key proponents:**
  - **Elizondo** (*Imminent*): Explicitly discusses consciousness as a factor. Uses "Somber" to describe full implications.
  - **Nolan** (Stanford): Studied caudate-putamen brain structures in UAP-exposed individuals. Found higher neuronal connection density. Not yet peer-reviewed in neuroscience journal.
  - **Vallée** (*Messengers of Deception*, 1979): Proposed UAP as a "control system" influencing human consciousness and culture across centuries.
  - **AAWSAP:** Lacatski's book reveals the program investigated consciousness effects, poltergeist phenomena, and biological impacts — not just aerospace anomalies.
- **Counter-argument:** "Consciousness" is ill-defined here; mixing consciousness studies with physical UAP investigation conflates two unsolved problems. No controlled experiment demonstrates a consciousness-UAP interaction.
- **Assessment:** TIER 3 — real research thread, credentialed proponents, no reproducible evidence.
- **Cross-References:** K01 (consciousness), K04 (quantum consciousness), K05 (Gateway Process), I06 (key figures)

## 6. Restored Legacy Notes (Pre-Feb 2026 Revision)

The following points are restored from the prior `I03` draft to ensure no previously captured material is lost.

### 6.1 AAWSAP / DIRD Legacy Context
- Prior version tracked the 38 DIA/AAWSAP DIRDs as an important historical research cluster (wormholes, warp-drive-related concepts, metamaterials, advanced propulsion topics).
- Legacy framing correctly noted these are mostly literature/research products, not public engineering demonstrations.

### 6.2 Ancient Comparison Framework (Retained as Interpretive Layer)
- Prior version included a modern-to-ancient capability comparison table (e.g., abrupt acceleration, trans-medium behavior, luminous object descriptions, "wheel within a wheel" motif).
- This remains an interpretive phenomenology bridge only; it is not treated as proof of shared mechanism or origin.

### 6.3 Vaimanika Shastra Caveat (Restored)
- The previous draft explicitly flagged that *Vaimanika Shastra* is a modern-era text and not authenticated as an ancient engineering manual.
- This caveat remains important for source hygiene and is preserved here.

### 6.4 Blumrich / Ezekiel Note (Restored)
- Prior draft included Josef Blumrich's engineering-style Ezekiel interpretation as a notable historical modern reading.
- This remains contested and should stay tiered as interpretive/speculative rather than evidentiary proof.

### 6.5 Earlier Cross-Links Preserved
- Legacy cross-link intent to biblical, vimana, and broader ancient technology threads remains valid as comparative context.
- Practical rule: keep those links as adjunct context, not as direct proof-chain for modern propulsion claims.

---

## 7. Add-Only Change Policy (from this point forward)

- Existing section content remains preserved.
- New findings are appended in new subsections/entries rather than replacing prior text.
- If a correction is needed, prior wording is retained with a dated correction note.

- Several authors hold mainstream academic positions (H. Puthoff, E. W. Davis, R. Baker)
- Released partially through FOIA; some remain redacted or withheld
- **Source:** Lacatski, Kelleher & Knapp, *Inside the U.S. Government Covert UFO Program*, 2023; FOIA releases

### 8.2 Metamaterials, Art's Parts & TTSA Material Analysis

- **Art's Parts / Magnesium–Bismuth Layering:**
  - Unknown-provenance metallic specimens have circulated since the 1990s ("Art's Parts" — named after Art Bell)
  - Layered structure: alternating magnesium and bismuth at micron-scale (26 alternating layers reported)
  - Linda Moulton Howe initially received samples from an anonymous Army source
  - Jacques Vallée and Garry Nolan (Stanford immunologist) conducted isotopic and structural analysis
  - **Nolan findings:** Isotope ratios are within terrestrial range but structure is "unusual"; no definitive conclusion of non-terrestrial origin
  - To The Stars Academy (TTSA) acquired samples for study (2017–2019)
  - **AARO/ORNL analysis (2023–2024):** ORNL tested submitted specimens; found compositions consistent with terrestrial industrial alloys. No exotic elements detected in publicly reported results.
  - **Tier:** T2–T3 — Specimens exist and have been tested, but no analysis has confirmed non-terrestrial origin
  - **Cross-ref:** I05 (crash retrieval materials), I06 (Vallée, Nolan)

- **To The Stars Academy (TTSA):**
  - Founded 2017 by Tom DeLonge with Elizondo, Mellon, Puthoff, Justice, others
  - Facilitated release of GIMBAL/GOFAST/FLIR1 videos
  - Claimed to have acquired metamaterial specimens for analysis
  - TTSA pivoted to entertainment/media; scientific arm reduced after key members departed
  - **Tier:** T2 for video releases (confirmed by DoD); T3 for material claims

### 8.3 Element 115 (Moscovium) — Assessment

- **Bob Lazar claimed (1989):** Element 115 was the fuel source for gravity amplifiers in craft at S-4 (near Area 51)
- Lazar stated it was impossible to synthesize and only available from off-world sources
- **2003:** Element 115 (now named Moscovium, Mc) was synthesized at Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), Dubna, Russia
- **Critical assessment:**
  - Lazar's "prediction" is often cited as vindication, BUT the existence of superheavy elements was predicted by nuclear physics models long before 1989
  - Synthesized Mc is radioactively unstable (half-life: ~220 ms for Mc-288); Lazar claimed a stable "island of stability" isotope
  - No stable isotope of Mc has been found; the predicted island of stability (around Z=114, N=184) is theoretical
  - Lazar's descriptions of Element 115 properties do not match observed nuclear properties of moscovium
- **Tier:** T3–T4 — Claim is chronologically interesting but scientifically unsubstantiated
- **Cross-ref:** I06 (Lazar profile)

### 8.4 Zero-Point Energy & Electrogravitics

- **Zero-Point Energy (ZPE):**
  - Quantum electrodynamics predicts vacuum fluctuations with non-zero ground-state energy
  - Casimir effect experimentally demonstrates vacuum energy (Lamoreaux, 1997)
  - Extractable ZPE as a propulsion source remains speculative; no peer-reviewed experiment has demonstrated net energy extraction
  - Puthoff (2002): "Engineering the Zero-Point Field and Polarizable Vacuum for Interstellar Flight" — *British Interplanetary Society Journal* 55, 137-144
  - DIRD papers addressed ZPE extraction as a theoretical possibility for advanced propulsion
  - **Tier:** T1 for vacuum energy existence; T3 for energy extraction; T4 for current propulsion applications

- **Electrogravitics:**
  - Thomas Townsend Brown (1920s–1960s): claimed asymmetric capacitor experiments demonstrated thrust correlated with electric field
  - Project Winterhaven (1952): Brown's proposal to the U.S. military for electrokinetic propulsion
  - Brown's experiments have been partially replicated: "lifter" devices demonstrate ion wind thrust, NOT gravitational modification
  - Mainstream physics does not validate electrogravitic claims
  - Alleged 1956 aerospace industry interest (declassified *Gravity Rand Ltd.* and *Lear* documents) suggest brief corporate exploration
  - **Tier:** T3 — Historical interest is documented; claimed mechanism is unvalidated
  - **Cross-ref:** J01 (ancient energy concepts)

### 8.5 Harold Puthoff — Publications & Research Program

- **Credentials:** PhD physics (Stanford, 1967); NSA; SRI International; Institute for Advanced Studies at Austin (IASA)
- **Key publications:**
  - "CIA-Initiated Remote Viewing Program at SRI" — *Journal of Scientific Exploration*, 1996
  - "Ground State of Hydrogen as a Zero-Point-Fluctuation-Determined State" — *Physical Review D*, 1987
  - "Engineering the Zero-Point Field and Polarizable Vacuum for Interstellar Flight" — *JBIS* 55, 2002
  - "Ultrafast Propulsion and Advanced Materials" — IRVA Conference presentations
  - Co-authored multiple AAWSAP DIRDs
- **Role in disclosure:** Senior scientist at TTSA; briefed Congressional committees; longtime advocate for UAP physics research
- **Assessment:** Legitimate physicist with peer-reviewed publications in mainstream journals, BUT later career publications are in more niche venues. Remote viewing work at SRI remains contested but was funded by DIA/CIA for 20+ years.
- **Tier:** T2 — Credentials strong; some conclusions speculative
- **Cross-ref:** I06 (key figures), K02 (remote viewing)

### 8.6 Ancient Vehicle Descriptions vs. Modern UAP Observables — Comparison Table

This table was present in a prior I03 draft and is restored here. It is an **interpretive phenomenological bridge** — NOT proof of shared mechanism or origin.

| Capability / Feature | Modern UAP Observable | Ancient Textual Description | Source Tradition | Database Doc |
|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Silent hovering | Anti-gravity lift (Observable #1) | Pushpaka Vimana "hovered motionless in the sky" | Hindu — *Ramayana* | J02 |
| Instantaneous acceleration | Sudden acceleration (Observable #2) | "Moved like lightning across the heavens" | Multiple traditions | C08 |
| No sonic boom at high speed | Hypersonic w/o signatures (Observable #3) | "Without sound it traversed the sky" | Hindu — *Samarangana Sutradhara* | J02 |
| Air-water transition | Trans-medium (Observable #4) | Oannes "returned to the sea at sunset" | Mesopotamia — Berossus | A07 |
| Intermittent visibility | Low observability (Observable #5) | "Appeared and disappeared at will" | Multiple traditions | C08, B01 |
| Luminous craft | Bright/glowing objects reported on FLIR | "Pillar of fire," "burning chariot," "celestial boat of fire" | Biblical, Egyptian, Vedic | A02, J02 |
| Disc/orb shape | Most common modern UAP geometries | "Wheel within a wheel" (Ezekiel), "flying shields" (Roman) | Biblical, Classical | A02, D08 |
| Beam of light directed downward | Laser-like beams (Rendlesham, Colares) | "Pillar of light descending from the sky" | Multiple | C08 |
| Biological entities associated | NHI descriptions by witnesses | Apkallu, Nagas, "sons of God," Watchers | Multiple | A04, A07, B01 |
| Underground/underwater bases | USO patterns; alleged base locations | Patala (Naga underworld), Dragon King palaces | Hindu, Chinese | C11, C12 |

**Caveat:** This table documents *descriptive parallels only*. The ancient texts are products of their cultural contexts. Phenomenological similarity does not establish causal connection.

### 8.7 Vaimanika Shastra — Extended Caveat (Restored)

- The *Vaimanika Shastra* (Science of Aeronautics) is frequently cited as evidence for ancient Indian flying machines
- **Critical provenance:** The text was dictated by Pandit Subbaraya Shastry between 1904–1923, claiming channeled knowledge from sage Bharadvaja
- It is NOT an ancient text — it is a modern-era composition
- **Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore study (1974):** Analyzed the Vaimanika Shastra's technical specifications; concluded the described aircraft "are poor concoctions rather than descriptions of something that could fly"
- The text describes mercury vortex engines and materials that do not correspond to known aerospace engineering principles
- **Assessment:** Culturally interesting as a modern attempt to codify ancient mythological flight traditions, but NOT evidence of historical aeronautical engineering
- **Tier:** T3–T4 for claims of ancient origin; T5 as a cultural/mythological document
- Genuine ancient references to aerial vehicles (Pushpaka in *Ramayana*, aerial cities in *Mahabharata*) are separate and older textual traditions

### 8.8 Blumrich / Ezekiel Wheel Interpretation (Restored)

- **Josef F. Blumrich** (1913–2002): NASA chief of structures at Marshall Space Flight Center
- Read Ezekiel (ch. 1, 10) intending to debunk von Däniken's spacecraft interpretation
- Instead produced *The Spaceships of Ezekiel* (1974) — engineering-style reconstruction of Ezekiel's vision as a landing craft
- Blumrich's design: four-wheeled chassis with helicopter-like rotors, conical capsule, landing legs
- **Granted U.S. Patent 3,789,947 (Feb 5, 1974)** for an omnidirectional wheel design inspired by his Ezekiel reconstruction
- **Critique:** Blumrich's interpretation is engineering speculation applied to poetic/prophetic religious text; modern biblical scholars read Ezekiel's merkaba vision as theophany (divine manifestation), not aircraft description
- **Tier:** T3 — Creative engineering interpretation; demonstrates that the text's imagery CAN be read as technological, not that it IS technological
- **Cross-ref:** A02 (Bible serpent/divine vehicle refs), J02 (vimanas)

### 8.9 Reverse Engineering Program Allegations

- Multiple whistleblowers (Grusch, Lazar, unnamed sources cited by Kean/Blumenthal) allege the U.S. and possibly other nations operate crash-retrieval reverse-engineering programs
- **Grusch's specific claims (2023):**
  - Programs predating his birth (pre-1987)
  - Multiple craft recovered across decades
  - Private aerospace contractors involved
  - "Inter-agency conflict" over access and oversight
- **AARO Vol. I (Feb 2024):** Investigated these claims; concluded "no evidence" of reverse-engineering programs or extraterrestrial technology
- **Wilson-Davis Memo (2002, leaked 2019):** Alleges DIA director denied access to SAP involving recovered craft managed by private contractor
- **Assessment:** The gap between sworn testimony and AARO findings is THE unresolved tension in this field. Both must be presented.
- **Tier:** T2 for sworn testimony existing; T3 for program content claims
- **Cross-ref:** I05 (crash retrievals), I06 (whistleblowers), H01 (suppression)

## 11. [RECENT] 2024–2026 Addendum

### 11.1 Evolving Analysis of the Five Observables (2025–2026)
- **Warp-Field Signature Modeling (2025):** Recent academic papers (e.g., published in *Open Journal of Applied Sciences*, late 2025) have begun explicitly linking the Five Observables to theoretical warp-field propulsion signatures. By consolidating these observables and examining their physical implications, researchers are providing a foundation for identifying potential warp-field signatures in future UAP reports, moving the conversation from phenomenology to applied physics.
- **Engineering Constraints Framework:** The Five Observables (positive-lift/anti-gravity, instantaneous acceleration, hypersonic speeds without signatures, low observability, and trans-medium travel) are increasingly being used by alternative propulsion researchers to translate pilot reports and multi-sensor tracks into strict engineering constraints and boundary conditions for theoretical physics models.
- **AARO Case Updates (Late 2025 - Early 2026):** The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) continues to release imagery of unresolved UAP reports (e.g., PR-013, PR-015 from Europe, added to the official database in Dec 2025 and Jan 2026). These ongoing releases confirm that objects displaying anomalous characteristics continue to be tracked and remain unresolved by current military analysis.
- **Civilian Sensor Networks:** The deployment of civilian UAP tracking networks (like the JRP UAP Network) has led to increased reporting of metallic objects displaying characteristics linked to the Five Observables, such as a notable sighting in Eastern Oklahoma in late December 2025. This highlights the shift from purely military encounters to open-source, multi-sensor civilian data collection.

## 13. SWEEP FINDINGS — Gap Priority Additions (Feb 2026)

> **Note:** The following sections were added during the Section I Sweep (Feb 2026). Per Add-Only Change Policy, existing content is preserved.

### 13.1 Missing Propulsion & Technology Claims

#### 13.1.1 DARPA / Tau Zero Foundation Connection (Tier 2)

- **Source:** Millis, Marc G. (former NASA Glenn Research Center). Tau Zero Foundation publications; DARPA 100 Year Starship Study (2011).
- DARPA funded the 100 Year Starship Study, a speculative propulsion research program exploring interstellar travel
- The Tau Zero Foundation (founded by Marc Millis, who ran NASA's Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Project 1996–2002) continues civilian research into advanced propulsion
- This institutional thread — from NASA BPP → DARPA 100YSS → Tau Zero → private research — represents a parallel track to AATIP/AAWSAP for advanced propulsion investigation
- **Assessment:** TIER 2 — Institutional funding and programs are documented; breakthrough results have not emerged

#### 13.1.2 Woodward Mach Effect Thruster (Tier 2–3)

- **Source:** Woodward, James F. *Making Starships and Stargates: The Science of Interstellar Transport and Absurdly Benign Wormholes*. Springer, 2013; NASA NIAC Phase I/II grants (2017+).
- James Woodward (Cal State Fullerton) developed a theoretical inertial mass variation thruster based on Mach's principle
- Predicts small thrust from piezoelectric devices experiencing rapid mass fluctuations
- NASA Space Technology Mission Directorate funded testing through NIAC (2017)
- **Results:** Inconclusive; measured thrust is at the limits of experimental noise
- Represents a separate theoretical approach from Alcubierre/Pais — uses Machian physics rather than GR metric engineering
- **Assessment:** TIER 2 for theoretical framework; TIER 3 for experimental results

#### 13.1.3 EmDrive — Full Arc (Tier 1 for debunking; Tier 3–4 for thrust claims)

- **Source:** Shawyer, Roger. EmDrive patent (2001); White, Harold et al. NASA Eagleworks testing; Tajmar, Martin et al. "The SpaceDrive Project." *AIAA Propulsion and Energy*, 2018.
- The EmDrive (Electromagnetic Drive) claimed to produce thrust from a closed microwave cavity without propellant — violating conservation of momentum
- **Timeline:**
  - 2001: Roger Shawyer (UK) patented the concept
  - 2014–2016: NASA Eagleworks (Harold White) reported anomalous thrust (~1.2 mN/kW). Media hype cycle.
  - 2018: Dresden University of Technology (Tajmar et al.) conducted rigorous testing with improved thermal/magnetic shielding → found NO statistically significant thrust above systematic errors
  - 2021: Additional null results confirmed; EmDrive interest collapsed in mainstream physics
- **Relevance to I03:** The EmDrive arc is a CAUTIONARY TALE for exotic propulsion claims. Initial positive results (White/Eagleworks) were not reproduced under stricter controls. This pattern should inform evaluation of ALL unconfirmed propulsion claims.
- **Assessment:** TIER 1 for the debunking; TIER 3–4 for the original thrust claims

#### 13.1.4 AARO Bayesian Analysis Framework (Tier 1)

- **Source:** AARO published methodology descriptions (2023–2024); AARO FAQ.
- AARO employs probabilistic/Bayesian frameworks for UAP case classification and resolution
- Uses prior probabilities based on known object populations (balloons, drones, satellites, aircraft) and adjusts based on sensor data quality
- This approach means that extraordinary claims require overcoming HIGH prior improbability — consistent with standard scientific methodology
- **Assessment:** TIER 1 — Official institutional methodology; important context for evaluating AARO's "no evidence" conclusions

### 13.2 Missing Counter-Arguments

#### 13.2.1 Patents ≠ Working Technology (Expanded)

- The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issues patents based on SUFFICIENT DESCRIPTION of an invention, NOT on proof of function
- Many granted patents describe non-functional devices (perpetual motion machines have been patented)
- The Pais patents' Navy assignment raises questions about WHY the Navy sponsored them, but Navy assignment does NOT validate the underlying physics
- **Key document:** Dr. Mark Rodeghier examined the Pais patents and noted that the claims lack experimental demonstration
- **Assessment:** The existence of Navy-assigned patents is Tier 1 fact. The physics claims within them remain Tier 3.

#### 13.2.2 "Five Observables" as Confirmation Bias Framework

- **Source:** Skeptical literature; West, Mick. Various analyses.
- Critics argue the Five Observables framework is reverse-engineered FROM witness reports, not derived from physics principles
- It functions as a Procrustean bed: diverse observations are forced into five pre-defined categories, which then appear to confirm a consistent phenomenon
- **Counter:** Elizondo and AATIP derived the framework from PATTERNS across independent cases; pattern recognition is a valid analytical method
- **Assessment:** This structural critique does not invalidate individual cases but cautions against using the framework as proof of a unified phenomenon

### 13.3 Element 115 (Moscovium) — Tier Adjustment

- **Current tier in I03:** T3–T4
- **Recommended adjustment:** Firm T4
- **Reason:** Synthesized Moscovium properties don't match Lazar's claims. The "prediction" was not unique — superheavy element existence was predicted by nuclear shell models decades before 1989. No stable isotope found. Lazar's descriptions of Element 115 behavior do not correspond to observed nuclear properties of Mc.
