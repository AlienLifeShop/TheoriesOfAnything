## QUICK SUMMARY

This document catalogs the most significant military and multi-witness UAP encounters from 1944 to the present, rated individually using the 5-tier system. The catalog includes 23 primary cases spanning 12 countries, with evidence types ranging from multi-sensor radar and infrared video to mass witness events with hundreds of observers. The "Five Observables" framework — anti-gravity lift, instantaneous acceleration, hypersonic velocity without signatures, trans-medium travel, and low observability — provides a consistent analytical lens across cases spanning 80 years.

## 2. THE "FIVE OBSERVABLES" — Quantitative Analysis

- **Source:** Elizondo, Luis, public statements (2017–present); Knuth, Kevin H., Robert M. Powell & Peter A. Reali, "Estimating Flight Characteristics of Anomalous Unidentified Aerial Vehicles," *Entropy* 21(10), 2019
- **DOI:** https://doi.org/10.3390/e21100939
- **Tier:** 2 — Peer-reviewed journal; data from confirmed military encounters

The Five Observables codified by Elizondo/AATIP:

| # | Observable | Description | Best Case Evidence |
|---|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Anti-gravity lift | Silent hovering; no visible propulsion | Nimitz Tic Tac, Rendlesham, Belgian Wave |
| 2 | Sudden/instantaneous acceleration | 0→extreme velocity in <1 second | Nimitz: estimated 40–80g (Knuth et al.) |
| 3 | Hypersonic velocity w/o signatures | No sonic boom, no thermal exhaust | Multiple radar-tracked cases |
| 4 | Trans-medium travel | Air↔water without deceleration | USS Omaha, Aguadilla, Nimitz |
| 5 | Low observability | Intermittent radar; visual/IR mismatch | Multiple sensor-fusion cases |

- SCU's Aguadilla analysis estimated object velocity at 40–120 mph transitioning air-to-water without deceleration
- Performance characteristics are consistent across independent cases spanning decades and nations

## 3. CONNECTIONS TO EXISTING DATABASE

- **I07 (USOs):** Omaha, Aguadilla, and Nimitz cases ALL involve trans-medium behavior → connects to A07 (Apkallu/Oannes emerging from the sea)
- **I04 (Nuclear):** Rendlesham is adjacent to nuclear-armed Bentwaters; Malmstrom cases in I04
- **C10 (Cargo Cult):** Ariel School (62 children witness beings + craft) is a modern analogue of cargo cult formation — real contact → mythologization within a generation
- **D08 (Ancient Art):** Visual descriptions (disc, orb, triangle, tic-tac) parallel shapes in ancient art documented in D08

## 5. DEBUNKING NOTES

- **GOFAST speed:** Parallax analysis by West (Metabunk) suggests object may be slower (~30 knots, wind-borne). SCU disputes the wind-borne interpretation. Both analyses should be evaluated.
- **Phoenix Lights 10 PM event:** Confirmed as Maryland ANG A-10 illumination flares. The 8 PM V-formation mass sighting remains unexplained — these are TWO SEPARATE events.
- **Rendlesham:** Skeptics (Ian Ridpath) propose lighthouse + bright stars; this fails to explain Halt tape audio, radiation readings, and ground indentations.
- **Belgian Wave famous triangle photo:** Admitted hoax by photographer (2011). However, radar data and 13,500+ other witnesses are unaffected by one fake photo.
- **Roswell:** USAF Project Mogul explanation (1994) is supported by trajectory/timing of Flight #4. The "crash test dummy" report (1997) is criticized for timeline discrepancies (dummies weren't dropped until 1953+).
- **Nimitz Tic Tac (skeptical view):** Mick West (Metabunk) argues elements of the Nimitz encounter can be explained by parallax effects, infrared glare rotation, and pilot misperception of distance/speed. Fravor directly disputes West's analysis, noting he was at ~0.5 mile visual range. Both positions should be evaluated on their technical merits.
- **Ariel School (skeptical view):** Susan Clancy and other psychologists argue mass suggestion and interview contamination — children were initially interviewed in groups, which promotes conformity. Counter: Randall Nickerson's documentary *Ariel Phenomenon* (2022) re-interviewed adult witnesses 27 years later; accounts remained consistent and detailed.

## 5B. ADDITIONAL KEY CASES — Gap Priority Expansion

### 5B.1 Lonnie Zamora / Socorro, New Mexico (Apr 24, 1964) — TIER 2

- **Source:** Project Blue Book case file; Hynek, J. Allen. *The UFO Experience*. 1972; Stanford, Ray. *Socorro 'Saucer' in a Pentagon Pantry*. 1976.
- Police Sergeant Lonnie Zamora (Socorro PD) was pursuing a speeder when he heard a roar and saw a flame in the sky
- Drove to the site and found an egg-shaped, white, metallic craft on four legs in a gully; two small figures in white coveralls standing beside it
- As Zamora approached, the figures re-entered the craft; it ignited with a blue/orange flame and ascended silently
- **Physical evidence:** Burned brush, 4 landing pad impressions in the soil (measured by military investigators), fused sand
- **Investigation:** Army, FBI, and Project Blue Book investigated. Blue Book classification: **UNIDENTIFIED** (one of 701 cases Blue Book could not explain)
- Hynek personally investigated; considered it one of the strongest cases due to: single credible witness (police officer on duty), physical trace evidence, immediate official investigation
- **Skeptical view:** Philip Klass proposed a mirage or hoax; no definitive debunking has gained consensus
- **Assessment:** TIER 2 — single witness, but physical trace evidence and immediate military investigation elevate it above anecdotal reports.

### 5B.2 Coyne Helicopter Incident (Oct 18, 1973, Mansfield, OH) — TIER 2

- **Source:** Zeidman, Jennie. "The Coyne Helicopter Case." CUFOS report, 1979; multiple publications.
- U.S. Army Reserve UH-1H helicopter (4-man crew), commanded by Captain Lawrence Coyne, en route Cleveland–Columbus
- Crew observed a red light approaching on collision course from the east
- Coyne initiated emergency descent (collective full down)
- A cigar-shaped, gray metallic object (~60 ft long) with a green light underneath passed directly over the helicopter, close range
- During the encounter, the helicopter's altimeter showed the aircraft was CLIMBING (~300 ft/min UP) despite the collective still being in the full-down position
- Radio malfunctioned during the encounter (both UHF and VHF)
- **Independent ground witnesses:** 5 civilians in a car on the ground below independently reported watching the encounter, including seeing the green light illuminate the helicopter and the ground
- **Assessment:** TIER 2 — 4 military crew + 5 independent ground witnesses + instrument anomalies. No credible debunking has been published. One of the strongest multi-witness military cases.

### 5B.3 1975 Northern Tier Wave (Oct–Nov 1975) — TIER 2

- **Source:** Dolan, Richard. *UFOs and the National Security State Vol. 2*. 2009; NORAD/FOIA documents.
- Over a period of several weeks in October–November 1975, multiple nuclear-armed U.S. and Canadian military bases experienced UAP incursions:
  - **Loring AFB, Maine (Oct 27–28):** UAP over nuclear weapons storage area (WSA). Base went to higher alert status. Unidentified helicopter-like object tracked for hours; could not be intercepted.
  - **Wurtsmith AFB, Michigan (Oct 30):** UAP over B-52 nuclear alert pad; KC-135 tanker crew visual. Security police observed low-altitude lights.
  - **Malmstrom AFB, Montana (Nov 7–8):** Additional UAP sightings (separate from the 1967 ICBM shutdown events already documented in I04). SAC bases went to heightened alert.
  - **Canadian Forces Bases (Falconbridge, North Bay):** NORAD tracked unidentified objects in Canadian airspace simultaneous with U.S. incidents.
- NORAD logs (FOIA-obtained) document these events as genuine unknowns — not identified as Soviet, civilian, or natural phenomena
- **Assessment:** TIER 2 — FOIA-documented multi-base nuclear incursion pattern. NORAD's own records confirm the events. The nuclear connection strengthens the I04 thesis.
- **Cross-References:** I04 (nuclear connection — this is the strongest multi-base nuclear-UAP pattern on record)

## 11. SWEEP FINDINGS — Gap Priority Additions (Feb 2026)

> **Note:** The following sections were added during the Section I Sweep (Feb 2026) to address identified gaps. Per Add-Only Change Policy, existing content is preserved.

### 11.1 Additional Military Cases Missing from Catalog

#### 11.1.1 Chiles-Whitted (Eastern Airlines Flight 576) — Jul 24, 1948 (Tier 2)

- **Source:** Project Sign case file; Hynek, *The UFO Experience*, 1972.
- Pilots Clarence Chiles and John Whitted reported a cigar-shaped, double-decker craft with glowing windows passing their DC-3 at ~700 mph over Montgomery, Alabama
- One passenger (Clarence McKelvie) independently confirmed seeing a bright streak
- Project Sign investigators considered this case a key driver of their "Estimate of the Situation" (interplanetary conclusion)
- **Tier:** T2 — Two experienced airline pilots; independent passenger corroboration; Blue Book case

#### 11.1.2 Gorman Dogfight — Oct 1, 1948, Fargo, ND (Tier 2)

- **Source:** Project Sign/Blue Book case file; Ruppelt, *The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects*, 1956.
- USAF Lt. George Gorman (North Dakota ANG) chased a luminous object for 27 minutes in an F-51 Mustang
- Object outmaneuvered his fighter repeatedly, making sharp turns and vertical climbs beyond aircraft capability
- Gorman described being "outclassed" by the object's performance
- Blue Book classification: **UNIDENTIFIED**
- **Tier:** T2 — Military pilot, extended engagement, official investigation

#### 11.1.3 RAF Lakenheath-Bentwaters — Aug 13–14, 1956 (Tier 1–2)

- **Source:** Condon Report Case 2 (pp. 248–256); UK National Archives; multiple radar station records.
- Multiple radar stations tracked fast-moving unknown over East Anglia
- RAF Venom night fighter scrambled; pilot obtained radar lock
- Object maneuvered BEHIND the interceptor — reversing pursuer/pursued roles
- Condon Report assessment: "the most puzzling and unusual case in the radar-visual files"
- **Gordon Thayer (Condon Report analyst):** Rated it "the probability of at least one genuine UFO involvement" as high
- **Tier:** T1–2 — Multiple independent radar stations, airborne radar lock, Condon Report's own strongest case

#### 11.1.4 Frederick Valentich Disappearance — Oct 21, 1978 (Tier 2)

- **Source:** Australian Department of Transport investigation; Melbourne FSS radio transcript (published).
- 20-year-old Australian pilot Frederick Valentich flew a Cessna 182 over Bass Strait
- Radioed Melbourne Flight Service: "large unknown aircraft hovering on top of me... it is not an aircraft"
- Last transmission cut off mid-sentence with metallic scraping sound
- Neither pilot nor aircraft were ever found despite extensive search
- Australian DOT investigation remains officially open — status: "unknown"
- **Tier:** T2 — Official radio transcript exists; investigation open; physical disappearance unexplained

#### 11.1.5 Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia — Oct 4, 1967 (Tier 1–2)

- **Note:** This case is documented in detail in I07 §8.1 but was MISSING from the I02 Master Case Catalog. Cross-listed here per Sweep recommendation.
- RCMP-documented; Canadian Department of National Defence investigated; government records classify it as "unsolved"
- One of only TWO government-documented USO events
- **Cross-Reference:** [I07 — USOs](I07_USO_Trans_Medium.md) §8.1 for full case detail
- **Tier:** T1–2

#### 11.1.6 Pentagon Confirmation of Unreleased Videos (Tier 1)

- **Source:** Pentagon statements to various media (2021+); Congressional correspondence.
- The Pentagon has confirmed possession of additional UAP imagery beyond FLIR1, GIMBAL, and GOFAST
- Stated that release would "harm national security"
- This confirmation is itself a Tier 1 fact — the government holds evidence it considers too sensitive to release
- **Assessment:** Documents the gap between what the government possesses and what has been shared publicly

### 11.2 Missing Counter-Arguments

#### 11.2.1 Nimitz "Distant Object" Interpretation

- **Source:** West, Mick. Metabunk analyses, 2019–2024.
- West argues Fravor's visual estimate of Tic Tac size (~40 ft) and distance (~0.5 miles) may be unreliable without ranging equipment
- Fighter pilots are trained in visual range estimation BUT are not infallible, especially with objects of unknown size acting as reference
- **Fravor's response:** He was at visual range during a controlled descent; his experience (18 years + combat) makes his distance estimate reliable
- **Both positions should be evaluated on technical merits**

#### 11.2.2 Belgian Wave — Mass Suggestion Hypothesis

- **Source:** Various psychosocial ufology literature; Paillou, Pierre. Belgian Wave re-analysis.
- Some psychologists proposed mass suggestion/social contagion for the 13,500+ witness reports
- **Counter:** Mass suggestion cannot explain F-16 radar lock data. Radar is not subject to psychological phenomena.
- The admitted hoax photo (2011) does not invalidate the independent radar evidence or other witness testimony
