## QUICK SUMMARY

Unidentified Submerged Objects (USOs) and trans-medium phenomena — craft moving seamlessly between air and water — represent one of the most intriguing intersections of modern UAP data and ancient tradition. Modern military cases (USS Omaha, Aguadilla, Nimitz) show objects entering/exiting water without deceleration. Ancient traditions across every continent describe intelligent beings emerging FROM water to impart knowledge (Oannes, Nagas, Nommo, Dragon Kings). This document catalogs both domains and maps the connections.

## 1. Verified Claims — Tier 1

### 1.1 NOAA Unexplained Ocean Acoustics

- **Source:** NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL)
- **Sounds on record:**
  - **Bloop** (1997): Originally mysterious; NOW explained as Antarctic ice calving
  - **Julia** (1999): Ice-related
  - **Upsweep** (ongoing): Volcanic origin likely
  - **Train** (1997): Ice
  - **Slow Down** (1997): Ice friction on sea floor
- **ASSESSMENT:** Most NOAA anomalous sounds are NOW explained by geological/ice processes. The "underwater NHI base" interpretation is NOT supported by NOAA data.
- **However:** 71% of Earth's surface is ocean; <5% of the deep ocean has been explored with any detail. The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

### 1.2 Modern Military Trans-Medium Cases (Confirmed Authentic)

Cases with DoD-confirmed video/sensor data showing trans-medium behavior:

| Case | Date | Evidence | Trans-Medium Detail | Tier |
|------|------|----------|-------------------|------|
| USS Omaha | Jul 2019 | NV video (Pentagon-confirmed) | Sphere enters water with no splash, no debris, no deceleration | 1–2 |
| Aguadilla, PR | Apr 2013 | DHS/CBP thermal camera | Object tracked at 40–120 mph entering/exiting water | 2 |
| Nimitz | Nov 2004 | FLIR + radar | Tic Tac observed hovering over "disturbance" in water before engagement | 1–2 |

---

## 2. Credible Claims — Tier 2

### 2.1 RADM Tim Gallaudet — Ocean UAP Advocate

- Former acting NOAA Administrator (Rear Admiral, USN Ret.)
- Publicly stated: "Trans-medium vehicles presenting unique observables in our oceans are real"
- Advocates for dedicated undersea UAP research program
- Founded Sol Foundation (with Nolan, Nell) — UAP research advocacy

### 2.2 Soviet/Russian Navy USO Encounters

- **Source:** Stonehill & Mantle, *Russia's USO Secrets*, 2020; Shulman, "Soviet Navy USO Files"
- Russian Navy accumulated decades of USO reports:
  - Objects tracked at 230+ knots underwater (impossible for any known submarine)
  - Lake Baikal — divers reported encountering "beings" at depth (Soviet military diving exercises, 1982)
  - Multiple submarine encounters in Arctic and Pacific
- Verification limited; post-Soviet disclosure reliability varies

---

## 3. Speculative Claims — Tier 3

### 3.1 Ivan Sanderson — Pioneer USO Research

- **Source:** Sanderson, Ivan T. *Invisible Residents: The Reality of Underwater UFOs*. World Publishing, 1970.
- First systematic USO catalog
- Proposed "OINTS" — Other Intelligences (potentially underwater)
- Identified 12 "vile vortices" — regions of anomalous disappearances (including Bermuda Triangle)
- **CRITIQUE:** Statistical methodology questionable; many "vile vortex" locations coincide with major shipping lanes (higher traffic = more incidents)

### 3.2 Ancient Water Being ↔ Modern USO Pattern Table

This is one of the most compelling cross-cultural parallels in the archive:

| Tradition | Water Being(s) | Characteristics | Arrival Method | Knowledge Given | Database Doc |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| Mesopotamia | Oannes/Apkallu | Fish-man hybrid | Emerged from Persian Gulf | Civilization, writing, law | A07 |
| India | Nagas | Serpent/human shapeshifters | Underwater kingdoms (Patala) | Vedic wisdom, medicine, weapons | C11 |
| China | Dragon Kings (龍王) | Dragon-human rulers | Underwater crystal palaces | Rain, agriculture, governance | C12 |
| W. Africa (Dogon) | Nommo | Amphibious beings | Arrived in "ark" from water/sky | Astronomy, agriculture | C05 |
| SE Asia (Khmer/Indonesian) | Naga | Serpent beings | Rivers, caves, oceans | Temple building, kingship | C06 |
| Pacific Islands | Tangaroa/Tagaloa | Sea god | Emerged from primordial ocean | Creation, navigation | C07 |
| W. Africa (Yoruba) | Olokun | Ocean deity | Rules ocean depths | Wealth, knowledge | C05 |
| Greece | Poseidon/Nereus | Sea gods | Underwater palace | Horse-taming, navigation | — |
| Celtic/Irish | Merfolk/Fomorians | Undersea beings | Arrived "from beneath the waves" | — | — |
| Brazil | Iara/Cobra Grande | River serpents | Amazon waterways | — | — |

**Pattern:** 10+ independent traditions describe intelligent beings emerging from water to interact with humans — the same behavior documented in modern trans-medium UAP cases.

---

## 4. CONNECTIONS TO EXISTING DATABASE

- **A07 (Apkallu/Oannes):** Most direct ancient parallel — amphibious beings emerging from sea to teach civilization. I07 adds modern trans-medium military data.
- **I02 (Military Encounters):** USS Omaha, Aguadilla, and Nimitz all exhibit trans-medium behavior documented in I02
- **I03 (Five Observables):** Trans-medium travel is Observable #4 — this document provides the deepest treatment
- **C05 (Credo Mutwa):** Chitauri described as having underwater/underground origins; Nommo from Dogon tradition
- **C11 (Nagas):** Indian tradition: entire serpent civilization exists in underwater kingdoms (Patala)
- **C06 (SE Asian Naga):** Naga Mucalinda shelters Buddha; Naga as foundation of Khmer kingship

## 6. GAPS REMAINING

- [ ] Dedicated military undersea UAP detection program (Gallaudet's proposal) has not been funded
- [ ] SOSUS/CAESAR hydrophone networks — UAP data (if any) classified
- [ ] Deep ocean exploration (~5% mapped in detail) — vast unknowns remain
- [ ] Chinese, Japanese, and Korean maritime UAP/USO reports largely untranslated
- [ ] Statistical analysis: USO hotspots vs. ocean features (trenches, volcanic vents, magnetic anomalies)

---

## 6B. ADDITIONAL USO/TRANS-MEDIUM CONTENT — Gap Priority Expansion

### 6B.1 SOSUS/IUSS — The Missing Data Set (Tier 1–2)

- **Source:** Official Navy documentation; Gallaudet, RADM Tim (ret.); various naval acoustics publications.
- **SOSUS (Sound Surveillance System)** / **IUSS (Integrated Undersea Surveillance System):** A global network of fixed hydrophone arrays on the ocean floor, originally deployed during the Cold War to track Soviet submarines
- Operated by the U.S. Navy's Undersea Surveillance Command; remains classified in operational detail
- SOSUS covers the Atlantic, Pacific, and key chokepoints with continuous passive acoustic monitoring
- After the Cold War, SOME SOSUS data was shared with NOAA for scientific use (whale tracking, seismic monitoring, the "Bloop" identification)
- **Relevance to USO investigation:**
  - If trans-medium UAP enter/exit the ocean, SOSUS arrays would have the best chance of acoustic detection
  - RADM Tim Gallaudet (ret.) has specifically called for declassification and analysis of Navy underwater sensor data for UAP signatures
  - The classified status of SOSUS UAP data (if any exists) parallels the classified status of satellite/radar UAP data discussed in I01/I03
  - **No publicly available SOSUS data has ever been released for UAP analysis**
- **Assessment:** TIER 1 for the system's existence and capability; the question of whether it has detected anomalous targets is unanswerable with public data.

### 6B.2 Avi Loeb — IM1 Ocean Floor Expedition (2023) (Tier 2–3)

- **Source:** Loeb et al. multiple preprints (2023–2024); Desch, S.J. et al. critical response; *Scientific American* reporting.
- **Background:** Interstellar meteor CNEOS 2014-01-08 ("IM1") — detected by U.S. government sensors on Jan 8, 2014, impacting near Papua New Guinea
- U.S. Space Command confirmed (2022) the object was of interstellar origin (hyperbolic trajectory, >95% confidence)
- **Expedition (June 2023):** Loeb's Galileo Project team used a magnetic sled to recover metallic spherules from the ocean floor along IM1's calculated trajectory
- **Claims:** Spherules had anomalous composition — "BeLaU" type (beryllium/lanthanum/uranium ratios not matching known solar system sources, meteorites, or terrestrial geological samples)
- **Criticism:**
  - Desch et al. (2023): Argued spherule recovery site is near a WWII-era ship wreck; spherules could be coal ash or industrial slag
  - Methodology concerns: Magnetic sled sampling from a zodiac boat in open ocean introduces contamination risks
  - The spherules' provenance (are they FROM IM1 or from the ocean floor background?) cannot be definitively established
  - Peer review: Loeb's team published primarily as preprints; formal peer-reviewed publication has been contested
- **Assessment:** TIER 2 for the concept (interstellar meteor ocean recovery is novel and scientifically interesting); TIER 3 for the anomalous composition claims (disputed methodology and alternative explanations). The most publicized ocean-related NHI material claim in 2023.
- **Cross-References:** I06 (Loeb profile), I03 (metamaterials analysis), D13 (underwater archaeological methodology)

### 6B.3 Scandinavian USO Cases — Cold War Underwater Unknowns (Tier 2)

- **Source:** Swedish Armed Forces declassified reports; Huchthausen, Peter. *October Fury*. 2002; various Swedish naval histories.
- During the Cold War, Scandinavian navies tracked unidentified underwater contacts that could not be attributed to Soviet submarines:
  - **Hårsfjrärden incidents (Oct 1982):** Swedish Navy detected multiple underwater contacts in the Stockholm archipelago; launched a major anti-submarine operation with depth charges, mines, and surface vessels. Operation lasted several weeks.
  - Sweden initially blamed the Soviet Union; Moscow denied involvement. The contacts' acoustic signatures did not match known Soviet submarine types.
  - A 1995 Swedish government commission concluded SOME incidents were likely Soviet submarines but others remained unexplained.
  - **Norwegian fjord incidents:** Similar unidentified underwater contacts tracked in Norwegian fjords through the 1970s–1980s
  - **Pattern:** Multiple Scandinavian naval operations against targets that performed maneuvers beyond known submarine capability (speed, depth changes, ability to operate in shallow/confined waters without surfacing)
- **Assessment:** TIER 2 — documented by national militaries with naval-grade sonar and ASW equipment. Some cases explained as Soviet intrusions, others genuinely unexplained. These represent the best-documented underwater unknowns outside the USO framework.

### 6B.4 Deep Ocean Bioluminescence as Mundane Explanation (Debunking Addition)

- The ocean environment produces numerous naturally luminous phenomena that could be misidentified as USOs:
  - **Bioluminescence:** ~76% of deep-sea organisms produce light (Martini & Haddock 2017). Large aggregations of bioluminescent organisms can create impressive light displays.
  - **Submarine volcanic activity:** Underwater eruptions at mid-ocean ridges produce light, heat, and acoustic signatures
  - **Geothermal vents:** Black smokers and white smokers create visible plumes and thermal/chemical signatures detectable by sensors
  - **Milky seas:** Rare bioluminescent events visible from space — documented by satellite (Miller et al. 2005, *PNAS*). Caused by massive bacterial aggregation (*V. harveyi*)
  - **Ball lightning over water:** Atmospheric plasma phenomena can appear to enter/exit water surfaces
- **Assessment:** These mundane explanations should be considered for ANY underwater light/acoustic anomaly before invoking non-human intelligence.

---

## 7. DEBUNKING NOTES

- **NOAA Bloop:** Explained as ice calving. Frequently misrepresented as "unexplained" in popular media — it is NOT unexplained as of 2012.
- **Sanderson's vile vortices:** Based on questionable statistics; high-traffic ocean areas naturally produce more incident reports.
- **Soviet USO reports:** Many come from post-Soviet disclosure and are difficult to verify against primary documentation. Russian ufology community is active but standards vary.
- **Ancient water beings:** The UNIVERSAL need for water in human settlement means ALL early civilizations were riverine/coastal. Water mythology may reflect this practical reality rather than actual underwater NHI.

## 8. Restored & Expanded Content (Feb 2026 — cases stripped by prior AI, rebuilt)

> **Note:** Per Add-Only Change Policy, the following sections append missing case material and expanded analysis.

### 8.1 Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia (October 4, 1967)

- **Source:** Styles, Chris & Graham Simms. *Dark Object: The World's Only Government-Documented UFO Crash*. Dell, 2001.
- **Classification:** One of only TWO government-documented USO events (alongside Canadian official records)
- **Event sequence:**
  - ~11:20 PM: Multiple witnesses (including RCMP officers) observed a large illuminated object (~60 ft) descend at 45° angle toward Shag Harbour
  - Object hit the water with a "whooshing" sound; left a trail of yellowish foam ~80 ft wide
  - Witnesses initially believed it was an aircraft crash
  - RCMP officers Constable Ron Pound and others arrived at the shore and observed a light on/in the water, moving slowly
  - Canadian Coast Guard and local fishing boats launched to rescue perceived aircraft survivors; found NO wreckage, NO survivors, only the foam/residue
  - Within hours, military divers from HMCS Granby searched; found nothing on the bottom
- **Official status:** Royal Canadian Mounted Police report filed; Department of National Defence investigated; case listed as "unsolved" in official Canadian government records
- **Government classification:** "UFO Report" — one of very few cases where a government used the term officially in records
- **Tier:** T1–T2 — Multiple law enforcement witnesses, official government investigation, documented in Canadian archives
- **Cross-ref:** I02 (military encounter catalog)

### 8.2 Puerto Rico Trench & Caribbean USO Concentration

- **Source:** SCU Aguadilla analysis (2013); Sanderson vile vortex mapping; multiple witness compilations
- The Puerto Rico Trench is the deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean (27,480 ft / 8,376 m at Milwaukee Depth)
- USO reports cluster near the trench and around Puerto Rico, including:
  - **Aguadilla (2013):** CBP thermal camera tracked object entering/exiting water (see I02, I07 §1.2)
  - **Roosevelt Roads Naval Station:** Multiple historical UAP/USO reports from now-closed base
  - **Vieques Island:** Witnesses report trans-medium objects near former Navy bombing range
- Sanderson identified the Caribbean as one of his 12 "vile vortices" — zones of anomalous activity
- **Statistical note:** Caribbean is also one of the world's busiest shipping/aviation lanes; higher observation density expected
- **Tier:** T2 for geographic clustering; T3 for causal interpretation

### 8.3 Lake Baikal Military Diver Encounters (1982) — Expanded

- **Source:** Soviet military reports (post-Soviet disclosure); Stonehill & Mantle, *Russia's USO Secrets*
- **Event:** During Soviet Naval training exercises at Lake Baikal (world's deepest freshwater lake, max depth 5,387 ft / 1,642 m):
  - Military divers at ~50 m depth reportedly encountered "humanoid beings" approximately 3 meters tall in silvery suits
  - Beings were not using any visible breathing apparatus
  - Commander ordered attempted capture; on ascent, three divers died from decompression sickness (the bends) after being "forcibly ejected" to the surface
  - Four additional divers were hospitalized
- **Assessment:** Account comes through post-Soviet disclosure channels; no primary documentation publicly available in English. Soviet military culture would have classified such events. The decompression deaths are verifiable as medical events; the encounter description is not independently confirmed.
- **Tier:** T3 — Soviet military source, post-facto disclosure, no primary docs available
- **Connection to traditions:** Lake Baikal holds religious significance in Buryat/Siberian shamanism as a sacred/spiritual body of water

### 8.4 Catalina Island Channel & USO Activity

- **Source:** Multiple civilian and military reports; marine observation compilations
- The San Pedro/Catalina Channel off Los Angeles has produced decades of USO sighting reports
- **Key cases:**
  - Multiple reports of illuminated objects moving underwater from fishing boats and pleasure craft
  - 1950s–60s: Navy sonar operators at nearby Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach reported anomalous underwater contacts
  - USS Nimitz (2004) Tic Tac engagement occurred in the same general Pacific coastal zone
- **Tier:** T3 — Civilian reports with some military corroboration; no confirmed sensor data released for sub-surface contacts

## 9. [RECENT] 2024–2026 Addendum

### 9.1 AARO Trend Data Relevance (Tier 1)

- AARO trend releases indicate many resolved reports map to conventional categories (balloons, UAS, satellites), setting a modern baseline that should be applied to trans-medium claims where sensor provenance is incomplete.
- This baseline improves discrimination between true trans-medium anomalies and misidentification clusters.

### 9.2 USO-Specific Evidence Constraint

- Publicly released USO events remain comparatively sparse in high-fidelity multi-sensor form versus airborne UAP cases.
- Therefore, strongest claims should be weighted toward events with documented sensor chain + operator testimony + timing consistency.

### 9.3 Operational Research Priority

- Prioritize coastal military exercise zones and maritime chokepoints where radar/EO/IR/sonar integration is more likely, rather than broad anecdotal aggregation.

### 9.4 Recent Archival Releases and Trans-Medium Focus (2025–2026)
- **NARA 2025 UAP Records Collection:** In August 2025, the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) formally stood up a dedicated UAP Records Collection, beginning rolling releases of government files. This aggregation of records from multiple agencies (including the DoD and Navy) is expected to provide further historical context on maritime and trans-medium encounters.
- **Ongoing AARO Analysis:** The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) continues to emphasize the "All-domain" aspect of its mandate, which explicitly includes trans-medium objects. While public releases of high-fidelity USO sensor data remain sparse, the institutional framework for tracking objects that transition between space, atmosphere, and water is now firmly established in law and policy (e.g., the UAP Disclosure Act of 2025).

## 11. SWEEP FINDINGS — Gap Priority Additions (Feb 2026)

> **Note:** The following sections were added during the Section I Sweep (Feb 2026). Per Add-Only Change Policy, existing content is preserved.

### 11.1 Missing USO/Trans-Medium Cases & Topics

#### 11.1.1 AUTEC — Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (Tier 2–3)

- **Source:** U.S. Navy facility information; Bermuda Triangle literature; informal reports from Navy personnel.
- **Location:** Tongue of the Ocean, Andros Island, Bahamas — a deep-water (6,000+ ft) naval testing facility
- AUTEC is the U.S. Navy's primary deep-water weapons testing and evaluation facility; used for submarine, sonar, and torpedo testing
- USO reports from Navy personnel stationed at or operating near AUTEC have persisted for decades:
  - Anomalous sonar contacts not matching known submarine signatures
  - Visual sightings of luminous objects entering/exiting the Tongue of the Ocean
  - Electronic anomalies during testing operations
- **Geographic note:** AUTEC is located within the Bermuda Triangle (connects to O02 — Anomalous Zones) and within one of Sanderson's 12 "vile vortices" (connects to O01 — Earth Grid)
- **Assessment:** TIER 2–3 — The facility's existence and purpose are Tier 1; USO reports from Navy personnel are credible but informally documented; no official Navy investigation of USO activity at AUTEC is publicly known
- **Cross-References:** O01 (ley lines/Earth grid — Sanderson vortices), O02 (Bermuda Triangle)

#### 11.1.2 Gulf of Mexico / USS Russell Pyramid UAP — 2019–2021 (Tier 2)

- **Source:** Corbell, Jeremy & George Knapp. Released footage via social media (2021); Pentagon confirmation.
- Night-vision footage reportedly from the USS Russell shows pyramid-shaped luminous objects above the ship
- Pentagon confirmed the footage was genuine and taken by Navy personnel
- Some of these objects reportedly descended toward the water surface
- **Skeptical analysis:** West (Metabunk) argued pyramid shapes are artifacts of triangular bokeh from night-vision camera aperture — stars filmed with the same equipment produce identical "pyramid" shapes
- **Assessment:** TIER 2 for footage authenticity (Pentagon-confirmed); the interpretation as anomalous trans-medium objects is DISPUTED. Bokeh artifact explanation is plausible for the visual shape.

#### 11.1.3 Malibu "Underwater Anomaly" (Tier 3–4)

- **Source:** Google Earth imagery; internet speculation (2014–present).
- Google Earth imagery shows a feature approximately 6 miles off the Malibu, California coast that has been interpreted by some as an artificial underwater structure or "USO base"
- The feature appears as a flat-topped mesa with pillar-like supports
- **Geological explanation:** Marine geologists identify it as a natural rock formation — a remnant of coastal erosion or volcanic geology, consistent with the Santa Monica Basin's geological characteristics
- No independent sonar survey, ROV investigation, or scientific study has confirmed anything anomalous about the formation
- **Assessment:** TIER 3–4 — Pareidolia applied to low-resolution satellite bathymetry. Included for completeness and to DOCUMENT THE DEBUNKING.

#### 11.1.4 Trans-Medium Physics — Hydrodynamic Impossibility Statement (Tier 1)

- **This physics context is MISSING from I07 and should be explicitly stated:**
- Water is approximately **800× denser** than air at sea level
- Any object transitioning from air to water without deceleration must:
  - Suppress the massive hydrodynamic drag force that should slow it
  - Avoid cavitation, shock waves, and splash/impact effects
  - Maintain structural integrity across the density discontinuity
- No known technology — natural or human-made — achieves seamless air-to-water transition without significant deceleration, splash, and energy dissipation
- The USS Omaha video shows an object entering water "with no splash, no debris, no deceleration" — this violates known hydrodynamics if taken at face value
- **Assessment:** TIER 1 as a physics statement; the observed trans-medium cases either (a) represent genuinely anomalous technology, (b) are misperceived (parallax, object passing behind wave surface), or (c) involve unknown natural phenomena

#### 11.1.5 Deep-Sea Mining & Future USO Detection (Tier 3)

- Emerging interest in deep-sea mineral extraction (particularly polymetallic nodules in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, Pacific) will significantly increase human presence in the deep ocean
- Companies (The Metals Company, GSR, DEME) are deploying remotely operated vehicles and sensor arrays to depths of 4,000–6,000 m
- If USO phenomena are real, increased deep-ocean instrumentation and human observation may produce new data
- RADM Gallaudet has specifically argued for leveraging ocean monitoring infrastructure for USO detection
- **Assessment:** TIER 3 — Speculative prediction; the infrastructure deployment is real (Tier 1) but USO detection value is hypothetical

### 11.2 Missing Counter-Arguments

#### 11.2.1 Water-Surface Optical Effects

- Many apparent "water entry" events could be explained by objects passing BEHIND wave surfaces, creating parallax illusions of submersion
- From an elevated observation point (ship, aircraft), an object descending toward the ocean can appear to enter the water when it actually passes behind a wave crest
- This effect is enhanced at oblique viewing angles and with fast-moving objects
- **Applicability:** May explain some visual-only USO claims; less applicable to cases with sonar or underwater sensor confirmation

#### 11.2.2 Confirmation Bias in Ancient Water-Being Parallels — Systematic Critique

- The Ancient Water Being ↔ Modern USO pattern table (§3.2) is compelling but reflects SELECTION BIAS:
  - EVERY early civilization was riverine or coastal because water is essential for agriculture and settlement
  - Water mythology is therefore UNIVERSAL regardless of NHI contact
  - Creation myths involving primordial waters, water gods, and sea beings are expected cultural products of water-dependent societies
  - For the parallel to be meaningful, one would need to show water-being traditions DIFFER from general water mythology in specific, testable ways (e.g., technical details matching modern trans-medium observations)
