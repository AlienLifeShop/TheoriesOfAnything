## 13. Key Takeaways

1. **Only one mass extinction is definitively linked to an asteroid impact** — K-Pg / Chicxulub (66 Ma)
2. **Earth has been hit by objects far larger than Chicxulub** — Vredefort and Sudbury occurred before complex life
3. **Tunguska (1908) is a warning shot** — a ~60 m object with no warning devastated 2,150 km²
4. **Planetary defense is improving** — >95% of 1 km+ NEOs catalogued; DART validated deflection
5. **Most impact evidence is lost** — plate tectonics recycles ocean floor every ~200 My; true impacts dwarf the ~194 confirmed structures
6. **Impacts may trigger volcanism** — Deccan Traps were erupting simultaneously with Chicxulub (antipodal focusing hypothesis)
