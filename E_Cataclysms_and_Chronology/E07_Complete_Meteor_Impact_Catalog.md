## Reliability Tiers Used in This Document
| Tier | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **TIER 1** | Verified — peer-reviewed, measured, confirmed by multiple agencies |
| **TIER 2** | Credible — debated but supported by multiple studies |
| **TIER 3** | Speculative — plausible but unverified |
| **TIER 4** | Dubious — unsupported or pseudoscientific |

## PURPOSE

This document is a **comprehensive catalog** of every known, suspected, and mythologically recorded impact event in Earth's history — from the planet-forming Theia collision to modern fireballs caught on dashcam. It also catalogs every significant **near-miss** event and known future close approaches. This expands E02 with exhaustive detail and additional events.

- Fossil meteorites found embedded in Swedish limestone
- Caused a 100× increase in meteorite flux to Earth for several million years

### Boltysh — The "Other" K-Pg Impact
- 24 km crater in Ukraine, dated to 65.17 Ma — just ~800,000 years BEFORE Chicxulub
- Some researchers propose it as a precursor impact that stressed ecosystems before the main event
- Re-dated in 2021 to be slightly older than previously thought

### Deccan Traps — Impact-Volcanism Connection
- Massive volcanic province in India was erupting simultaneously with Chicxulub
- Antipodal focusing hypothesis: focused seismic energy from the impact may have amplified volcanism
- Hull et al. (2020): Chicxulub caused the extinction; Deccan Traps contributed to environmental stress but were not sufficient alone

## 9. THE TAURID COMPLEX & CYCLICAL BOMBARDMENT

**Reliability: TIER 2** 

### 9.1 The Taurid Meteor Stream

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Parent body** | 2P/Encke (short-period comet) |
| **Stream width** | ~30 million km |
| **Earth crossing** | Twice annually (June/November) |
| **Encke's period** | 3.3 years — shortest of any known comet |
| **Proposed by** | Victor Clube & Bill Napier (1982, *The Cosmic Serpent*); expanded by Asher & Steel (1998) |

### 9.2 The Giant Comet Hypothesis
- A giant comet (100–200 km) entered the inner solar system ~20,000–30,000 years ago
- Has been fragmenting into the Taurid Complex ever since
- Major fragment streams periodically intersect Earth's orbit
- Could explain cyclical civilizational collapses and "fire from the sky" traditions
- The Younger Dryas impact hypothesis (see E01) may be linked to a Taurid fragment

### 9.3 Celestial Serpent Connection
- Clube & Napier titled their book *The Cosmic Serpent* because ancient "sky serpent" traditions may encode cometary observations
- Ancient cultures worldwide described comets as **serpents or dragons** in the sky
- Chinese: "flying dragons"; Mesoamerican: "feathered serpents" (Quetzalcoatl = "precious twin" = Venus/comet); Norse: Jörmungandr (Midgard Serpent encircling the world)
- The Babylonian *Enuma Elish*: Tiamat as a celestial serpent/dragon shattered into pieces — possible cometary fragmentation memory?

## 15. KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. **Earth has been struck by objects capable of ending civilization multiple times** — only one (Chicxulub) killed off the dinosaurs because the others predated complex life
2. **The human era has seen multiple significant impacts** — Kaali, Campo del Cielo, Chelyabinsk — and near-misses that missed by hours (4581 Asclepius, 1989)
3. **Chelyabinsk was completely undetected** before impact — a 20 m object at 500 kt energy
4. **2023 BU passed closer than satellites** — only 3,600 km from Earth's surface
5. **Apophis will pass inside geostationary satellite orbits** in 2029 — visible to the naked eye
6. **~60% of dangerous asteroids (≥140 m) remain undiscovered**
7. **Mythological traditions worldwide** encode impact memories — from the Finnish Kalevala to the Sodom narrative (Tall el-Hammam, 2021)
8. **The Taurid Complex** represents an ongoing bombardment risk from a fragmenting giant comet
9. **DART proved deflection is possible** — humanity has its first defense tool validated
