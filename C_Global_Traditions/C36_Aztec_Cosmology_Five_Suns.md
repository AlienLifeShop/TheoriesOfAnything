## QUICK SUMMARY

Aztec (Mexica) cosmology describes the universe as having passed through **four previous ages (Suns)**, each created and destroyed by different gods through catastrophic events — jaguars, wind, fire-rain, and flood. We live in the **Fifth Sun** (Nahui Ollin, "4 Movement/Earthquake"), which will also be destroyed — by earthquakes. This cyclical cosmogony, recorded in sources like the *Leyenda de los Soles* and the *Aztec Sun Stone*, encodes a worldview in which creation is not a single event but an ongoing process requiring constant maintenance through ritual — especially human sacrifice, understood as repaying the "blood debt" owed to the gods who sacrificed themselves to set the current Sun in motion. The parallels to global cataclysm traditions and cyclical cosmologies are extensive and significant.

## 1. THE AZTEC WORLD — CONTEXT

### 1.1 Who Were the Aztecs? [4/5 sources]

The **Aztec** (more precisely, **Mexica**) were a Nahuatl-speaking people who:
- Migrated from the legendary homeland of **Aztlan** (location debated; possibly northwest Mexico) beginning ~12th century CE
- Founded **Tenochtitlan** in ~1325 CE on an island in Lake Texcoco (modern Mexico City)
- Built the **Triple Alliance** (Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, Tlacopan) into the dominant empire of Mesoamerica by 1428 CE
- At their height (~1500 CE), governed 5–6 million people and controlled territory from the Pacific to the Gulf of Mexico
- Were conquered by Hernán Cortés and allied Indigenous forces in 1521 CE

## 2. THE FIVE SUNS — COSMIC AGES

### 2.1 The Creation Cycle [4/5 sources]

Aztec cosmogony describes five successive world-ages, each governed by a different deity and destroyed by a different catastrophe. The order varies between sources; the most commonly cited sequence (from the *Leyenda de los Soles*):

| Sun | Name | Governing Deity | Duration | Destruction | Survivors |
|-----|------|----------------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **1st** | **Nahui Ocelotl** (4 Jaguar) | Tezcatlipoca | 676 years | Jaguars devour the world's inhabitants | Transformed to jaguars |
| **2nd** | **Nahui Ehecatl** (4 Wind) | Quetzalcoatl | 364 years | Hurricane/wind destroys the world | Transformed to monkeys |
| **3rd** | **Nahui Quiahuitl** (4 Rain) | Tlaloc | 312 years | Rain of fire (volcanic?) destroys the world | Transformed to turkeys/birds |
| **4th** | **Nahui Atl** (4 Water) | Chalchiuhtlicue | 676 years | Massive flood submerges the world | Transformed to fish |
| **5th** | **Nahui Ollin** (4 Movement) | Tonatiuh | Current (since 3114 BCE?) | Earthquakes will destroy | — |

### 2.2 The Theological Conflict [3/5 sources]

The Five Suns narrative is driven by **divine competition** — specifically the rivalry between **Tezcatlipoca** ("Smoking Mirror") and **Quetzalcoatl** ("Feathered Serpent"):

- **1st Sun**: Tezcatlipoca becomes the sun; Quetzalcoatl knocks him from the sky with a stone club; Tezcatlipoca falls and, enraged, sends jaguars to destroy the world
- **2nd Sun**: Quetzalcoatl becomes the sun; Tezcatlipoca kicks him from the sky; Quetzalcoatl sends a great wind that destroys everything and transforms people into monkeys
- **3rd Sun**: Tlaloc governs; Quetzalcoatl sends a rain of fire
- **4th Sun**: Chalchiuhtlicue (water goddess) governs; destroyed by flood
- **5th Sun**: Created through collective divine sacrifice at **Teotihuacan** (see §3)

This pattern of competing divine factions — one associated with knowledge and wind (Quetzalcoatl), the other with night, sorcery, and mirrors (Tezcatlipoca) — echoes the **two-faction pattern** documented across traditions:
- Enki vs. Enlil (Sumerian — see [A09](../A_Foundations/A09_Enki_Enlil_and_Sumerian_Leaders.md))
- Prometheus vs. Zeus (Greek — see [C18](../C_Global_Traditions/C18_Prometheus_Forbidden_Knowledge_Archetype.md))
- YHWH vs. the Serpent (Biblical — see [A02](../A_Foundations/A02_Bible_Serpent_References.md))

### 2.3 The Sun Stone [3/5 sources]

The **Aztec Sun Stone** (Piedra del Sol), a massive carved basalt disk (3.6 meters diameter, ~24 tons), encodes the Five Suns cosmology:

- **Center face**: Tonatiuh (the Fifth Sun) or possibly Tlaltecuhtli (earth lord), tongue extended as a sacrificial knife
- **Four surrounding squares**: The four previous Suns (4 Jaguar, 4 Wind, 4 Rain, 4 Water) with their destruction dates
- **Inner ring**: 20 day-signs of the tonalpohualli (260-day calendar)
- **Outer ring**: Turquoise/solar rays; two fire serpents (Xiuhcoatl) whose mouths meet at the base, from which emerge two deity faces

The Sun Stone is not a calendar per se — it is a **cosmogram**, a compressed graphical representation of the entire Aztec model of time and creation.

## 3. THE CURRENT SUN — NAHUI OLLIN

### 3.1 The Creation at Teotihuacan [4/5 sources]

The creation of the Fifth Sun is narrated as occurring at **Teotihuacan** — significantly, the Aztecs did not build Teotihuacan (it was already a ruin by their time), but they set the origin of the current cosmic age there. The account in the Florentine Codex:

1. After the Fourth Sun's destruction, the gods gather in darkness at Teotihuacan
2. Two gods volunteer to become the new sun: the proud, wealthy **Tecuciztecatl** and the humble, diseased **Nanahuatzin**
3. A great fire is built; **Tecuciztecatl hesitates four times** at the edge of the flames
4. **Nanahuatzin leaps into the fire without hesitation** and is consumed
5. Shamed, Tecuciztecatl follows
6. Nanahuatzin rises as the **Sun (Tonatiuh)**; Tecuciztecatl rises as the equally bright **Moon**
7. The other gods, angered that the Moon is as bright as the Sun, throw a rabbit at it — hence the "rabbit in the moon" visible on the lunar surface
8. But the Sun **does not move** — it demands blood
9. The gods **sacrifice themselves** to set the Sun in motion — their blood and hearts power the Fifth Sun's journey across the sky

### 3.2 The Implications [3/5 sources]

This creation narrative has profound theological consequences:

- The gods **died** to create the current world → humans owe a **blood debt**
- The Sun requires continuous **feeding** with blood (especially hearts) to keep moving → human sacrifice is cosmic maintenance, not cruelty
- The humble, willing sacrifice (Nanahuatzin) succeeds where proud hesitation (Tecuciztecatl) fails → **sacrifice must be willing**
- The current Sun is destined to end in **earthquakes** → there is no permanent safety

Brundage (1983) argues that the Five Suns cosmology was deliberately developed or elaborated by **Tlacaelel** (1397–1487), the chief advisor to multiple Aztec emperors, as an ideological framework to justify imperial expansion and mass sacrifice. Whether the basic Five Suns framework predates Aztec political manipulation remains debated.

## 4. THE STRUCTURE OF THE COSMOS

### 4.1 Vertical Structure — Thirteen Heavens and Nine Underworlds [3/5 sources]

Aztec cosmology describes a vertical axis of multiple cosmic levels:

**Thirteen Heavens (Ilhuicatl):**
- Levels 1–2: Moon and stars
- Level 3: Sun's path
- Level 4: Venus (Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli)
- Levels 5–9: Various celestial phenomena (comets, night sky, storms, blue sky)
- Levels 10–12: Realm of the gods
- Level 13: **Omeyocan** — "Place of Duality," dwelling of **Ometeotl** (the dual god/goddess of all creation)

**Nine Underworlds (Mictlan):**
The dead must traverse nine levels to reach Mictlan's final level, facing trials at each:
1. Cross the river Apanohuayan (aided by a dog)
2. Pass between clashing mountains
3. Climb the Obsidian Mountain
4. Cross the wind of obsidian knives
5. Cross the place of waving banners
6. Be shot with arrows
7. Cross the place of jaguars that eat hearts
8. Cross the place of the dead
9. Reach **Mictlan** — final destination, rest with Mictlantecuhtli

This nine-level underworld journey is structurally parallel to:
- The **Sumerian** seven gates of the underworld (see [C20](../C_Global_Traditions/C20_Seven_Level_Cosmology_Seven_Gates.md))
- The **Egyptian** twelve hours of the Duat
- The **Tibetan** bardo passages
- The **Orphic** descent (see [C25](../C_Global_Traditions/C25_Orpheus_Descent_Underworld_Archetype.md))

### 4.2 Horizontal Structure — Four Directions [3/5 sources]

| Direction | Color | Deity | Tree | Significance |
|-----------|-------|-------|------|-------------|
| **East** | Red | Xipe Totec, Tlaloc | Thorny ceiba | Sunrise, new life, fertility |
| **North** | Black/White | Tezcatlipoca, Mictlantecuhtli | Thorny tree | Death, cold, sacrificial knives |
| **West** | White/Yellow | Quetzalcoatl, Chalchiuhtlicue | Maize plant | Sunset, women, rain |
| **South** | Blue/Green | Huitzilopochtli, Xochiquetzal | Willow | War, hummingbird, left |
| **Center** | Green/Multi | Xiuhtecuhtli (fire god) | World Tree | Axis mundi, fire, time |

The center — where all four directions meet — is the site of the **axis mundi** (the great ceiba or world tree), which connects the thirteen heavens, the terrestrial plane, and the nine underworlds. Tenochtitlan itself was conceived as this cosmic center — the **navel of the world** — with the Templo Mayor as the literal axis.

## 5. TIME — THE INTERLOCKING CALENDARS

### 5.1 The Dual Calendar System [4/5 sources]

| Calendar | Name | Days | Components | Function |
|----------|------|------|------------|----------|
| **Ritual** | **Tonalpohualli** | 260 | 20 day-signs × 13 numbers | Divination, ritual, personal destiny |
| **Solar** | **Xiuhpohualli** | 365 | 18 months × 20 days + 5 "empty" days (nemontemi) | Agricultural, civic, seasonal festivals |
| **Calendar Round** | — | 18,980 (= 52 years) | Point when both calendars realign | Full cosmic cycle; New Fire Ceremony |

### 5.2 The New Fire Ceremony (Xiuhmolpilli) [3/5 sources]

Every **52 years**, when the two calendars realigned, the Aztecs performed the **New Fire Ceremony** — one of the most dramatic rituals in human history:

1. All fires throughout the empire were **extinguished**
2. All pottery was broken, household goods destroyed
3. Pregnant women were locked in granaries (belief: they would turn into monsters if the Fifth Sun ended)
4. The entire population waited in darkness and terror
5. Priests ascended **Hill of the Star** (Huixachtlan) and watched for the **Pleiades** to cross the zenith
6. When the Pleiades crossed, a **sacrificial victim's chest was opened**, and a **new fire was drilled** in the chest cavity
7. The new fire was carried by runners to every temple and household across the empire
8. The world had survived another 52-year cycle

This ceremony is a **performed cosmology** — the terror of cosmic destruction is enacted and resolved through ritual, reinforcing the entire theological framework of precarious existence requiring blood to maintain.

---

## 6. THE BLOOD DEBT — HUMAN SACRIFICE AS COSMIC MAINTENANCE

### 6.1 Scale and Theology [3/5 sources]

Aztec human sacrifice was practiced on a scale unparalleled in documented world history:

- **Templo Mayor** dedication (1487 CE): Sources claim 4,000–84,000 victims over four days (the higher numbers are likely exaggerated; modern estimates suggest 4,000–20,000)
- Regular sacrifice throughout the 18 monthly festivals
- **Flower Wars** (xochiyaoyotl) — staged battles specifically to capture sacrificial victims

The theological justification:
1. The gods sacrificed themselves to create the Fifth Sun
2. The Sun needs blood (especially the heart = "precious eagle cactus fruit") to maintain its movement
3. Failure to provide sacrifice = the Sun stops = cosmic destruction
4. Humans are not victims but **participants in cosmic maintenance**

### 6.2 The Ethical Dimension [3/5 sources]

Klein (1975) argues that Aztec death imagery should be understood within its cosmological context — death was not annihilation but transformation, part of the cosmic cycle. Sacrificial victims were believed to:
- Become companions of the Sun (warriors died in sacrifice accompanied the Sun for 4 years)
- Or travel to specific afterlife realms based on manner of death (drowned → Tlalocan, paradise of Tlaloc)
- Or be transformed — as in each previous Sun, destruction = transformation into new forms

This does not justify the practice by modern ethical standards, but it places it within an internally consistent cosmological framework.

## 7. CATACLYSM PARALLELS

### 7.1 The Five Suns and Global Catastrophe Traditions [3/5 sources]

The Five Suns cycle parallels catastrophe narratives worldwide:

| Aztec Destruction | Global Parallel |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| **4 Water** (flood) | Near-universal flood myths (see [C02](../C_Global_Traditions/C02_Global_Flood_Stories.md)) |
| **4 Rain** (fire from sky) | Sodom/Gomorrah; Hindu pralaya; volcanic eruptions as divine punishment |
| **4 Wind** (hurricane) | Cyclonic destruction myths; Enlil's wind weapon |
| **4 Jaguar** (predator attack) | Primordial chaos before civilization |
| **4 Movement** (earthquake) | Earthquakes as world-ending force; seismic apocalypse traditions |

The Fourth Sun's destruction by flood is most directly parallel to the global flood tradition documented in [C02](../C_Global_Traditions/C02_Global_Flood_Stories.md) and [E14](../E_Cataclysms_and_Chronology/E14_Younger_Dryas_Impact_Theory.md). The overlap raises the question: do these traditions preserve memory of actual Younger Dryas or earlier catastrophic events, or do they reflect universal human anxieties about natural disaster?

### 7.2 Cyclical Time vs. Linear Time [2/5 sources]

The Aztec model of cyclical creation-destruction stands in sharp contrast to the Abrahamic linear model (single creation → history → single apocalypse):

- **Hindu Yugas**: Four cosmic ages, cyclically repeating — close parallel
- **Buddhist kalpas**: Vast time cycles of creation and destruction
- **Hopi worlds**: Four previous worlds, each destroyed; currently in the Fifth World (remarkably close to the Aztec Five Suns)
- **Norse Ragnarök**: Destruction followed by rebirth — cyclical within a single-cycle framework

The Hopi parallel is particularly striking — a neighboring Mesoamerican/Southwestern tradition with an identical "five worlds" structure, raising questions about shared origin.

---

## 8. COUNTER-ARGUMENTS AND SCHOLARLY DEBATE

### 8.1 Against Pre-Contact Antiquity [3/5 sources]

- The Five Suns narrative as recorded may have been significantly shaped by **Tlacaelel** and the Aztec imperial project in the 15th century CE
- Colonial-era sources (post-1521) are filtered through Christian scribes who may have reshaped the narrative
- The "original" pre-Aztec version of the Five Suns may be irrecoverable

### 8.2 Against Cataclysm Memory [3/5 sources]

- The Five Suns may encode general anxieties about natural disaster (earthquakes, floods, hurricanes are common in Mesoamerica) rather than memories of specific events
- The parallels with other traditions may reflect shared cognitive patterns rather than shared history
- "Pattern matching" across cultures risks imposing connections not present in the source material

### 8.3 Against Sacrifice Interpretations [3/5 sources]

- Sacrifice may have served primarily **political** rather than cosmological purposes — ideological justification for imperial terror
- The blood-debt theology may be a post-hoc rationalization, not the original motivation
- Competing interpretations exist within Mesoamerican studies regarding scale and significance
