## QUICK SUMMARY

**Māori mythology** — the cosmological tradition of the Polynesian people of Aotearoa (New Zealand) — contains one of the world's most philosophically sophisticated creation narratives, moving from **Te Kore** (the Void/Potential) through **Te Pō** (darkness/becoming) to **Te Ao Mārama** (the world of light). At the heart of the tradition lies the **separation of Ranginui** (Sky Father) and **Papatūānuku** (Earth Mother) by their children — a cosmogonic act that parallels myths worldwide (→ C53, C55). Linking everything is **whakapapa** — the sacred genealogical system that connects every human, animal, plant, mountain, and river in an unbroken chain back to the primordial parents. Whakapapa is not merely record-keeping; it is an **ontological framework** establishing identity, rights, and relationships between all beings. The Māori tradition also preserves extraordinary knowledge of **Polynesian deep-ocean navigation** (→ C37) — navigating thousands of miles of open Pacific using stars, waves, and birds. The related concepts of **mana** (spiritual authority/power), **tapu** (sacred restriction), and **kaitiakitanga** (environmental guardianship) constitute a complete ethical-metaphysical system that challenges Western distinctions between nature and culture, sacred and profane.

## 1. OVERVIEW — MĀORI COSMOLOGY

### 1.1 The Cosmogonic Sequence [5/5 sources]

| Phase | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **1** | **Te Kore** (The Void) | Not emptiness but **pure potential** — the realm of non-being, possibility, and unrealized becoming |
| **2** | **Te Pō** (The Night/Darkness) | Multiple stages of darkness (~10–12 levels); gestation; the gods forming within darkness |
| **3** | **Ranginui + Papatūānuku** | Sky Father and Earth Mother locked in eternal embrace; children trapped in darkness between them |
| **4** | **Separation** | Tāne Mahuta pushes sky and earth apart → light enters → Te Ao Mārama (the world of light) |
| **5** | **Te Ao Mārama** (The Natural World) | The visible world; creation of humans, plants, animals, landforms |

### 1.2 The Children of Rangi and Papa [5/5 sources]

| Child (Atua) | Domain | Role in Creation |
|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| **Tāne Mahuta** | Forests, birds, light | Separates sky and earth (pushing with his back and legs); creates first woman from earth; brings knowledge |
| **Tū-matauenga** | War, humanity | Ancestor of humans; the only child to stand against Tāwhirimātea's storms |
| **Tangaroa** | Sea, fish, reptiles | Flees to the ocean; his children become fish and sea creatures |
| **Rongo-mā-Tāne** | Cultivated plants, peace | Domain of agriculture; peace-making |
| **Haumia-tiketike** | Wild food plants, ferns | Hidden in the earth; uncultivated vegetation |
| **Tāwhirimātea** | Wind, storms, weather | **Opposes the separation** — attacks his brothers; only Tū can withstand his fury |
| **Rūaumoko** | Earthquakes, volcanic activity | Unborn child still within Papa's womb; his movements cause earthquakes |

## 2. THE CREATION NARRATIVE — SEPARATION OF EARTH AND SKY

### 2.1 The Debate Among the Gods [5/5 sources]

Before separating their parents, the children **debate what to do** — a remarkable deliberative scene:

| Position | Advocate | Argument |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Kill the parents** | Tū-matauenga | Radical solution — destroy them to be free |
| **Separate them** | Tāne Mahuta | Push them apart — sky above, earth below — allowing light | 
| **Leave them together** | Tāwhirimātea | Loves his parents; opposes all change |
| **Outcome** | Tāne prevails | He pushes with his legs against Rangi and his hands against Papa; slowly, painfully, he separates them |

The **tears of Ranginui** (rain) and the **sighs of Papatūānuku** (mist rising from the earth) continue to this day — the parents mourn their eternal separation.

### 2.2 Cross-Cultural Parallels [4/5 sources]

| Tradition | Sky-Earth Separation | Means |
|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| **Māori** | Ranginui/Papatūānuku | Tāne pushes them apart with his body |
| **Egyptian** | Nut (Sky)/Geb (Earth) | Shu (Air) lifts Nut above Geb |
| **Sumerian** | An (Sky)/Ki (Earth) | Enlil separates them → A01 |
| **Greek** | Kronos separates Ouranos/Gaia | By castrating Ouranos → C58 |
| **Chinese** | Pangu separates heaven/earth | Grows taller pushing them apart for 18,000 years |

### 2.3 The Creation of Humanity [5/5 sources]

**Tāne** creates the first woman, **Hine-ahu-one** ("Earth-formed Maiden"), from the earth at Kurawaka:
- He breathes life into her (cf. Genesis 2:7 — Yahweh breathes into Adam)
- Tāne mates with Hine-ahu-one; she bears **Hine-tītama** (Dawn Maiden)
- Tāne mates with his own daughter; when she discovers this, she flees to the underworld
- She becomes **Hine-nui-te-pō** ("Great Woman of the Night") — the goddess of death
- All humans must pass through her domain — hence **death enters the world through incest and shame**

## 3. WHAKAPAPA — SACRED GENEALOGY

### 3.1 What Is Whakapapa? [5/5 sources]

**Whakapapa** (literally "to lay one layer upon another") is:

| Dimension | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Genealogical** | Record of descent — who descends from whom, tracing back to the atua (gods) |
| **Ontological** | Everything IS its whakapapa — identity = genealogy; to know something, trace its ancestry |
| **Relational** | Establishes kinship between all things — humans, animals, mountains, rivers, stars |
| **Legal** | Land rights, chiefly authority, and tribal membership determined by whakapapa |
| **Cosmological** | Connects the human world to the divine — unbroken chain from Te Kore to the present |

### 3.2 How Whakapapa Works [4/5 sources]

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Whakapapa tūhono** | Primary descent lines — connecting to founding ancestors |
| **Whakapapa whānui** | Lateral connections — establishing relationships between groups |
| **Cosmogonic whakapapa** | Genealogies of the cosmos — Te Kore → Te Pō → atua → humans |
| **Recitation** | Memorized and recited in formal contexts (marae, ceremonies); errors are serious spiritual/political matters |

A trained **tohunga** (expert/priest) might recite whakapapa stretching back **30+ generations** (600+ years) with complete accuracy.

### 3.3 Whakapapa as Philosophy [4/5 sources]

Whakapapa collapses Western distinctions:
- **No nature/culture divide** — rivers, mountains, forests have genealogies connecting them to humans
- **No past/present divide** — ancestors are perpetually present through whakapapa
- **No individual/collective divide** — identity is constituted through relations, not isolated selfhood
- The **2017 Whanganui River Awa Tupua** legal personhood (the first river granted legal personhood worldwide) is a direct application of whakapapa thinking to law

## 4. MANA, TAPU, AND NOA — THE SPIRITUAL FRAMEWORK

### 4.1 Core Concepts [5/5 sources]

| Concept | Meaning | Application |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Mana** | Spiritual authority, prestige, power — inherited AND earned | Chiefs have mana from genealogy; warriors gain mana from victories; objects can carry mana |
| **Tapu** (Taboo) | Sacred restriction; set apart; potentially dangerous | A chief's head is tapu; burial grounds are tapu; new-born children are tapu |
| **Noa** | Ordinary, safe, unrestricted; the complement of tapu | Food is noa; daily activities are noa; rituals move things from tapu → noa |
| **Utu** | Reciprocity, balance — both positive (gift exchange) and negative (retribution) | Offenses must be balanced; gifts must be reciprocated; cosmic balance maintained |
| **Kaitiakitanga** | Guardianship/stewardship of the natural world | Humans are kaitiaki (guardians), not owners, of the environment |

### 4.2 Tapu in Daily Life [4/5 sources]

- Warriors before battle: **highly tapu** — cannot eat with hands, touch ordinary objects
- Carving a waka (canoe): the carver is tapu; specific rituals before/during/after
- Death: body and area become tapu; specific cleansing rituals needed
- **Tā moko** (facial tattoo): the process renders the person tapu; sacred identity carved into flesh

## 5. NAVIGATION, MIGRATION, AND CULTURAL HEROES

### 5.1 Polynesian Navigation (→ C37) [5/5 sources]

The Māori migrated to Aotearoa from Eastern Polynesia (Hawaiki) ~1250–1300 CE:
- Navigated ~2,000+ miles of open Pacific Ocean
- Used **star compasses**, ocean swells, wind patterns, bird behavior, cloud formations
- The **waka hourua** (double-hulled voyaging canoe) carried families, plants, animals, and sacred knowledge
- Each major iwi (tribe) traces descent from a specific waka (canoe) — the **Waka Migration** tradition names 7+ founding canoes

### 5.2 Māui — The Trickster Demigod [5/5 sources]

**Māui** — the great Polynesian culture hero — features prominently:

| Exploit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Fishes up the North Island** | Te Ika-a-Māui ("The Fish of Māui") — the North Island of NZ is Māui's fish |
| **Slows the Sun** | Beats the sun (Te Rā) with his grandmother's jawbone to make days longer |
| **Steals fire** | Obtains fire from the goddess Mahuika's fingernails (→ Prometheus parallel) |
| **Dies seeking immortality** | Enters Hine-nui-te-pō's body to reverse death; is crushed — death remains permanent |

Māui's failure to defeat death is the **complementary narrative** to Hine-tītama's transformation — death is established from both directions.

## 6. COUNTER-ARGUMENTS AND SCHOLARLY DEBATE

| Claim | Supporting Evidence | Counter-Evidence | Assessment |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| Māori cosmogony is among the most philosophically sophisticated creation narratives | Te Kore → Te Pō → Te Ao Mārama sequence rivals any philosophical cosmogony; deliberative council of gods | Sophistication claim involves comparison value judgments; all cosmogonies are "sophisticated" in context | **Tier 1** — the philosophical depth is genuinely remarkable |
| Whakapapa demonstrates a non-Western ontology | River personhood; kinship with landforms; genealogical identity | Could be metaphorical rather than ontological | **Tier 1** — whakapapa IS the ontology, not a metaphor for something else |
| Polynesian navigation implies advanced technical knowledge without Western instruments | Hōkūleʻa voyages (1976–present) proved the methods work; star compass knowledge documented | Knowledge was partly lost by contact period; modern reconstructions may differ from ancient practice | **Tier 1** — navigation capability conclusively demonstrated |
| Io (supreme god) was an authentic pre-contact belief | Taught in whare wānanga (schools of learning); some traditions include Io as the ultimate source | Io may be a post-contact addition (missionary influence → monotheism); first documentation is 19th century | **Tier 2-3** — genuinely debated; tribal traditions vary |
| Māori mythology parallels prove global diffusion | Sky-earth separation, trickster demigod, culture hero motifs found worldwide | Polynesian traditions are clearly related to each other; parallels with non-Polynesian myths likely independent | **Tier 2** — common patterns probably reflect shared cognitive architecture, not direct contact |
