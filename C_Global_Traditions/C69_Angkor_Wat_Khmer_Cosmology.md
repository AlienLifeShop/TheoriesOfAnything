## QUICK SUMMARY

**Angkor Wat** is the largest religious monument ever built — a **162.6-hectare** temple complex in northwestern Cambodia, constructed under **King Suryavarman II** (r. ~1113-1150 CE) as a Hindu temple dedicated to **Vishnu**. It represents the supreme expression of the **temple-mountain** concept: an architectural recreation of **Mount Meru**, the cosmic axis of Hindu-Buddhist cosmology (→ C53), surrounded by moats symbolizing the **cosmic ocean**. But Angkor Wat was only one monument within **Greater Angkor** — revealed by 21st-century **LIDAR surveys** to be the largest pre-industrial urban complex on Earth, covering **1,000+ km²** with an estimated population of **750,000-1,000,000** at its peak (larger than any contemporary European city). The **Khmer Empire** (802-1431 CE) ruled much of mainland Southeast Asia through a cosmological system centered on the **devaraja** ("god-king") concept: the king was the earthly manifestation of a specific Hindu deity, and royal temples served as both governance centers and **cosmic machines** designed to maintain cosmic order. The hydraulic infrastructure — massive reservoirs (*barays*), canals, and water management systems — sustained intensive rice agriculture but also made the civilization vulnerable to the **climate disruptions** (megadroughts alternating with mega-monsoons, 14th-15th centuries → E09) that contributed to Angkor's eventual decline. The transition from **Hinduism to Theravada Buddhism** (13th-14th centuries) transformed both the religious landscape and the power structure, replacing divine kingship with Buddhist merit-based legitimacy.

## 1. THE KHMER EMPIRE

### 1.1 Historical Timeline [5/5 sources]

| Period | Dates | Key Events |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Pre-Angkorian** (Funan/Chenla) | ~1st-8th century CE | Indianized kingdoms in lower Mekong; Sanskrit adoption; Hindu-Buddhist synthesis begins; trade with India, China |
| **Foundation** | 802 CE | **Jayavarman II** declares independence from Java; establishes devaraja cult on Phnom Kulen; founds Angkor |
| **Consolidation** | 9th-10th century | Construction of Bakong, Preah Ko, Phnom Bakheng; Yasovarman I creates East Baray (7.5 × 1.8 km reservoir) |
| **Classical Angkor** | 11th-12th century | Peak of Hindu temple construction; **Suryavarman II** builds Angkor Wat (~1113-1150); empire extends from Vietnam to Burma |
| **Buddhist Transformation** | Late 12th-13th century | **Jayavarman VII** (r. ~1181-1218) — greatest builder; converts to Mahayana Buddhism; builds Angkor Thom, Bayon, Ta Prohm, Preah Khan |
| **Theravada Transition** | 13th-14th century | Theravada Buddhism replaces Mahayana and Hinduism; less monumental building; shift to wooden architecture |
| **Decline** | 14th-15th century | Thai invasions (Ayutthaya sacks Angkor 1431); climate instability; capital shifts to Phnom Penh area |
| **Rediscovery** | 19th century | Henri Mouhot "discovers" Angkor (1860, though locals always knew); French colonial archaeology begins |

### 1.2 Cosmological Framework [5/5 sources]

| Concept | Hindu Form | Buddhist Form | Architectural Expression |
|---------|------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| **Cosmic Mountain** (Meru) | Abode of the gods; center of the universe; 5 peaks | World system center; Trayastrimsa heaven on summit | Temple mountains with 5 towers (quincunx) |
| **Cosmic Ocean** | Surrounds Meru; site of the Churning | Same in Buddhist cosmology | Moats surrounding temple complexes |
| **Devaraja** (God-King) | King = earthly form of Shiva or Vishnu | King = bodhisattva or chakravartin (world-ruler) | Royal temples house the king's linga/image |
| **Naga** (Serpent) | Vasuki used as rope in Churning; Shesha supports Vishnu | Mucalinda sheltered the Buddha | Naga balustrades on causeways; multi-headed cobra motifs |
| **Apsara** (Celestial Nymph) | Born from the Churning of the Sea of Milk | Merit-generated celestial beings | ~3,000+ apsara carvings at Angkor Wat alone |

## 2. ANGKOR WAT

### 2.1 Architectural Data [5/5 sources]

| Feature | Measurement/Detail |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Total area** | 162.6 hectares (402 acres) including moat |
| **Moat** | 190 m wide; 5.5 km perimeter; represents the cosmic ocean |
| **Causeway** | 350 m long western approach; naga balustrades |
| **Central tower** | 65 m (213 ft) high; represents Mount Meru's peak |
| **Five towers** | Quincunx arrangement representing Meru's five peaks |
| **Galleries** | Three concentric enclosures rising toward the center; ~800 m of narrative bas-reliefs in the outer gallery |
| **Orientation** | Faces **west** (unique among Angkor temples, most face east) — debated: funerary function? Vishnu association with west? |
| **Construction** | ~5-10 million sandstone blocks; quarried from Phnom Kulen (~40 km away); transported by canal/river; no mortar (precision-cut interlocking) |
| **Workforce** | Estimated 300,000+ workers (including 6,000 elephants) over ~30-37 years |

### 2.2 The Churning of the Sea of Milk — Key Bas-Relief [5/5 sources]

- **Location:** East wing of southern gallery; 49 m long
- **Narrative:** Devas (gods) and asuras (demons) use the serpent Vasuki as a rope wrapped around Mount Mandara, pulling alternately to churn the cosmic ocean
- **Products of the Churning:** Amrita (elixir of immortality), Lakshmi (goddess of fortune), the apsaras, various treasures, and halahala (poison, consumed by Shiva)
- **Political meaning:** The king (Suryavarman II, depicted as Vishnu) oversees the cosmic process — the state IS the churning, maintaining order between opposing forces
- **Astronomical interpretation:** Some scholars (e.g., Eleanor Mannikka) argue the bas-relief encodes **astronomical measurements**: the number of devas and asuras corresponds to solar/lunar cycles

### 2.3 Astronomical Alignments [4/5 sources]

| Alignment | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Spring equinox** | Sun rises directly over the central tower when viewed from the western causeway (→ D06) |
| **Summer solstice** | Sunrise alignment with specific gallery features near Phnom Bakheng |
| **Gallery dimensions** | Mannikka (1996) argued gallery proportions encode yuga (cosmic age) durations in Vedic astronomy |
| **Precession?** | Graham Hancock proposed Angkor temple layout mirrors Draco constellation at ~10,500 BCE; this is rejected by archaeologists but noted as an alternative claim (→ G03) |

## 3. ANGKOR THOM, BAYON

### 3.1 Jayavarman VII's Buddhist Revolution [5/5 sources]

- **Jayavarman VII** (r. ~1181-1218 CE): Perhaps the greatest Khmer king; converted the empire from Hinduism to **Mahayana Buddhism**; built more structures than all previous kings combined
- **Angkor Thom** (9 km² walled city, 3 km per side): New capital built around the **Bayon** temple
- **Bayon:** ~216 serene stone faces (often identified with Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva of compassion — or Jayavarman VII himself, or both) gazing in all directions
- **Ta Prohm:** University/monastery complex; deliberately left partially unrestored with trees growing through it; inscription records 12,640 functionaries, 79,365 support staff
- **Preah Khan:** Temple-monastery-university complex dedicated to Jayavarman VII's father; 515 deities in the central sanctuary

### 3.2 Infrastructure Scale [4/5 sources]

| Construction | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Hospitals** | 102 hospitals built across the empire; stone inscriptions record medications and formulas |
| **Rest houses** | 121 rest houses along pilgrimage/trade routes |
| **Roads** | Network spanning hundreds of kilometers with bridges and causeways |
| **Reservoirs** | West Baray (8 × 2.1 km, holding ~56 million m³ of water) — still partially functioning |

## 4. THE HYDRAULIC CITY

### 4.1 Water Management System [5/5 sources]

| Component | Scale | Function |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **East Baray** | 7.5 × 1.8 km | Seasonal water storage; rice agriculture support; temple island at center (East Mebon) |
| **West Baray** | 8 × 2.1 km | Largest; ~56 million m³ capacity; still holds water today |
| **Canals** | Hundreds of kilometers | Distribution channels connecting barays to rice paddies; some large enough for boat transport |
| **Siem Reap River** | Diverted and channeled | City water supply; temple moat systems |
| **Rice agriculture** | Multiple harvests per year possible | Rice surplus funded temple construction and armies |

### 4.2 Climate Vulnerability [4/5 sources]

- **LIDAR and dendrochronology** studies reveal that Greater Angkor's water system was designed for **normal monsoon variability**
- 14th-15th century climate records show alternating **severe droughts** and **extreme flooding** — outside the system's design parameters
- Buckley et al. (2010): Tree-ring data from Vietnamese cypress trees show anomalous climate during Angkor's decline period
- The hydraulic system's centralized nature meant that **failure cascaded** — unlike dispersed agricultural systems
- This finding supports the **climate-civilization nexus** observed in other collapse events (→ S10, E09)

## 5. DECLINE AND REDISCOVERY

### 5.1 LIDAR Revelations [5/5 sources]

- **2012-2015:** Damian Evans and team used airborne LIDAR to penetrate jungle canopy
- Revealed **Greater Angkor** as a **1,000+ km² urban landscape** — the largest pre-industrial city complex ever documented
- Discovered previously unknown temple complexes, road networks, spiral-shaped mounds, neighborhoods, and industrial areas
- Mahendraparvata (Phnom Kulen) revealed as an early urban grid with sophisticated water management
- Confirmed that Angkor was not an isolated monument but a **continuous urban landscape** serving ~750,000-1,000,000 people

### 5.2 Current Challenges [3/5 sources]

- **Tourism pressure:** ~2.6 million visitors/year (pre-COVID); structural stress; ground subsidence from groundwater extraction
- **Restoration:** International collaboration (APSARA Authority, UNESCO, teams from Japan, France, India, Germany, etc.)
- **Living landscape:** Local communities continue to live within and around Angkor; Buddhist monasteries active at many temples
- **Looting:** Ongoing problem; many statues removed and sold on black market; war damage from Khmer Rouge period

## 6. COUNTER-ARGUMENTS AND SCHOLARLY DEBATE

| Claim | Supporting Evidence | Counter-Evidence | Assessment |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| Angkor was the world's largest pre-industrial city | LIDAR data showing 1,000+ km² urbanized landscape; population estimates 750,000-1,000,000 | "Urban" definition debated; low-density sprawl vs. concentrated city; Song Dynasty Hangzhou may rival in population density | **Tier 1** — by area, confirmed largest; by population density, debatable |
| Temple construction encodes astronomical data | Equinox alignment verified; Mannikka's dimensional analysis; solstice alignments at multiple temples | Some numerical arguments are selective; multiple interpretive frameworks possible; confirmation bias risk | **Tier 1-2** — equinox alignment is confirmed; deeper astronomical encoding argues are Tier 2 |
| Climate change caused Angkor's decline | Tree-ring data shows anomalous climate; hydraulic system vulnerability documented; Evans & Fletcher studies | Climate was ONE factor; Thai military pressure; internal political fragmentation; religious shift to Theravada reduced monumental building motivation | **Tier 1-2** — climate was a significant contributing factor, not sole cause |
| Angkor mirrors Draco constellation at 10,500 BCE | Hancock's pattern comparison | No archaeological evidence for 10,500 BCE dating; temple construction dates are well-established; pattern matching is subjective | **Tier 3** — rejected by mainstream archaeology; noted as alternative claim |
