## QUICK SUMMARY

The **Inuit, Yupik, and Aleut** peoples of the Arctic — collectively known as **Eskimo-Aleut** or **Inuit-Yupik-Unangan** — developed one of humanity's most extraordinary spiritual-ecological systems in the world's harshest habitable environment. Their cosmology centers on **Sila** (the atmospheric spirit of weather, breath, and consciousness), **Sedna** (the sea goddess who controls marine animals), and a dense ecology of **inua** (indwelling spirits within all things). The **angakkuq** (shaman) served as the primary mediator between humans and spirits, undertaking **spirit flights** to Sedna's undersea home, the moon, or the weather-spirit realm (→ K15). Inuit cosmology demonstrates a profound understanding that **human survival depends on respectful reciprocity with animal spirits** — violating taboos causes Sedna to withhold seals, creating famine. This tradition represents the **western terminus** of the circumpolar shamanic continuum stretching from Siberia across Beringia (→ C46, C60) and preserves some of humanity's oldest adaptive knowledge systems (→ C13). Colonialism, missionization, and residential schools severely disrupted these traditions, but they persist and are being actively reclaimed across the Arctic.

## 1. INUIT PEOPLES AND CULTURAL CONTEXT

### 1.1 Geographic and Cultural Range [5/5 sources]

| Group | Region | Population (approx.) | Key Features |
|-------|--------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Inuit** (multiple groups) | Canada (Nunavut, NWT, Quebec, Labrador), Greenland | ~180,000 | Sea-ice hunting culture; Inuktitut language family |
| **Yupik** | Western Alaska, St. Lawrence Island, Siberian coast | ~35,000 | Bowl-drum tradition; distinct languages |
| **Aleut/Unangan** | Aleutian Islands | ~15,000 | Maritime specialists; mummification practice |
| **Iñupiat** | Northern Alaska | ~20,000 | Whaling culture; nalukataq (blanket toss) |

**Note on terminology:** "Eskimo" is considered inappropriate in Canada and Greenland (use "Inuit"), but acceptable in Alaska where "Yupik" peoples prefer it to "Inuit." This document uses specific group names where possible.

### 1.2 Archaeological Antiquity [4/5 sources]

- **Paleo-Eskimo cultures:** Earliest Arctic settlers ~5,000 years ago (Denbigh Flint Complex, Saqqaq)
- **Dorset culture** (500 BCE–1500 CE): Rich artistic tradition, shamanic figurines, mysterious disappearance when Thule expanded
- **Thule culture** (~1000 CE): Direct ancestors of modern Inuit — whaling technology, dog sleds, snowhouses
- **Beringia connection:** All Arctic peoples trace ultimate ancestry to populations crossing from Siberia — maintaining the circumpolar continuum (→ C46, E18)

## 2. COSMOLOGY — SILA, SEDNA, AND THE SPIRIT WORLD

### 2.1 Sila — The Breath of the World [5/5 sources]

**Sila** (also *Hila*, *Silap Inua*) is perhaps the most philosophically sophisticated concept in Inuit cosmology:

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Weather | Sila IS the weather — wind, snow, storms as conscious forces |
| Breath/Air | The atmosphere as a living, aware medium |
| Consciousness | The "mind of the world" — wisdom, intelligence, awareness pervading everything |
| Moral force | Good behavior brings good weather; taboo violation brings storms and starvation |

Knud Rasmussen recorded the angakkuq **Aua** explaining: *"We do not believe; we fear... We fear Sila."*

Sila closely parallels concepts in other traditions: Greek **pneuma**, Sanskrit **prana**, Chinese **qi**, Hebrew **ruach** — the "breath = spirit = consciousness" equation (→ C64).

### 2.2 Sedna — The Sea Goddess [5/5 sources]

**Sedna** (also *Nuliajuk*, *Nerrivik*, *Takánakapsâluk*) is the most important Inuit deity — a young woman who became goddess of the sea:

**Core myth (with regional variations):**
1. A young woman refuses all suitors (or is tricked into marrying a bird-spirit)
2. She is thrown from a boat by her father during a storm
3. She clings to the gunwale — her father chops off her fingers
4. Her fingers become the **seals, walruses, whales, and fish**
5. She sinks to the sea floor where she rules over all marine animals
6. When humans violate taboos, her hair becomes tangled and filthy — she withholds animals in anger
7. The angakkuq must journey underwater to **comb Sedna's hair** and restore the animal supply

**Significance:** Sedna embodies the principle that **food is a gift from a conscious being**, not a resource to be extracted. Her myth encodes the entire ethical-ecological relationship between Inuit and the sea.

### 2.3 Inua — The Indwelling Spirit [5/5 sources]

Every being and significant object possesses an **inua** ("its person/owner"):
- Animals have inua — and must be treated with respect even after being killed (returning bones to the sea, offering fresh water to a killed seal's mouth)
- Places have inua — dangerous locations, productive hunting sites, unusual rock formations
- Tools have inua — a well-used harpoon or ulu (knife) develops spiritual presence
- The Moon has an inua (**Alignak/Igaluk**) — traditionally male, controlling tides and menstruation; destination of some shamanic flights

## 3. THE ANGAKKUQ — INUIT SHAMANIC PRACTICE

### 3.1 Becoming an Angakkuq [4/5 sources]

Inuit shamanic calling parallels Siberian patterns but with distinctive features:
- **Solitary ordeal:** Typically involves extended fasting and exposure to cold — sometimes at the edge of the ice, sometimes in a tiny igloo
- **Acquisition of tuurngaq** (helping spirits): Spirits come to the aspirant during the ordeal — animal spirits (bears, walruses, birds) or spirit-beings
- **Qaumaniq** ("enlightenment"): A mystical light perceived within and around the shaman — described as seeing through darkness, through bodies, through deception
- Rasmussen recorded the angakkuq **Iglugarjuk** describing initiation: *"I could see through the darkness of life... all that was hidden from others"*

### 3.2 Shamanic Techniques [5/5 sources]

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Spirit flight (ilimmarneq)** | Soul leaves body to travel to Sedna's realm, the moon, or distant places |
| **Divination (sacailak)** | Head-lifting: a heavy object placed on a person's head, questions asked — the weight changes with spirit answers |
| **Séance (qaggiq)** | Public ceremony in the large igloo — drum dancing, shaman bound with ropes, spirits arrive (lamps are extinguished, voices speak) |
| **Healing** | Diagnosis of taboo violations causing illness; confession extraction; soul retrieval |
| **Weather control** | Negotiating with Sila through songs and offerings to change wind, stop blizzards |
| **Irinaliutit** | Magical words/songs with power — some inherited, some obtained from spirits |

### 3.3 The Journey to Sedna [5/5 sources]

The most dramatic shamanic journey in Inuit tradition:
1. Community gathers in the **qaggiq** (ceremonial snowhouse)
2. Lamps extinguished — total darkness
3. Angakkuq enters trance, falls through the earth/ice
4. Encounters obstacles: boiling cauldron, great dog guardian, turning wheel of ice
5. Reaches Sedna at the bottom of the sea — her hair tangled with human sins
6. Combs and braids Sedna's hair while confessing all community taboo violations
7. Sedna releases animals — the angakkuq returns
8. Community members then publicly confess specific violations to complete the restoration

## 4. SOUL CONCEPTS AND AFTERLIFE

### 4.1 Multiple Souls [4/5 sources]

Inuit cosmology recognizes multiple soul components:

| Soul-Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| **Atiq** (name-soul) | A name carries the personality/spirit of its previous holder — naming a child after a dead person transfers that person's qualities |
| **Tarniq** (breath-soul) | The individual life-spirit that leaves at death |
| **Anirniq** (wind/spirit) | The broader spiritual essence connected to Sila |

### 4.2 Afterlife Geography [4/5 sources]

Two primary post-death destinations:
- **Land of the Dead above** (with the Moon-spirit): For those who die violently or in childbirth — a joyful place with abundant game, endless ball-games
- **Land of the Dead below** (Sedna's realm): For those who die of illness or old age — dimly lit but not punitive

**Note:** NEITHER destination is punishment-based — Inuit afterlife lacks the heaven/hell moral dichotomy of Abrahamic traditions (→ P07).

### 4.3 Reincarnation and Name-Souls [4/5 sources]

Inuit practice a form of **name-based reincarnation** — when an elder dies, the community carefully watches for signs of their return:
- A baby may be named after a recently deceased person based on dreams or physical resemblances
- The child is then considered a partial reincarnation of the name-bearer
- Children may be addressed by kinship terms appropriate to the deceased ("grandmother"), regardless of the child's age or sex
- This creates a system where **death is not final** and the community maintains continuity (→ K21)

## 5. ENVIRONMENTAL KNOWLEDGE AS SPIRITUAL PRACTICE

### 5.1 Ice Knowledge (Siku) [5/5 sources]

Inuit knowledge of sea ice constitutes one of humanity's most sophisticated environmental knowledge systems:

| Term (Inuktitut) | Description |
|---|---|
| **Siku** | Sea ice (general) |
| **Sikuliaq** | New thin ice — dangerous |
| **Qinu** | Slush on water surface |
| **Ivuniit** | Pressure ridges from ice collision |
| **Tuvaq** | Landfast ice — stable, safe platform |
| **Aajuraq** | Crack in ice from tidal action |
| **Maniilaq** | Rough, hummocked ice |
| **Qaimukti** | Ice that has refrozen after breaking |

This vocabulary represents thousands of years of accumulated observation. Climate change is **destroying this knowledge base** as ice patterns become unpredictable — elders report that traditional ice categorization is becoming unreliable for the first time in memory (→ S10).

### 5.2 Animal Knowledge and Reciprocity [4/5 sources]

Inuit ecological ethics rest on **reciprocal obligations**:
- Animals **choose** to give themselves to respectful hunters — the hunter does not "take" the animal
- After killing a seal: offer it fresh water (it is thirsty from salt), keep bones together, return them to the sea
- **First-catch rituals:** A boy's first seal is shared with the entire community — the animal's spirit sees generosity and tells other seals
- **Taboo system:** Complex rules preventing the mixing of sea and land animals (e.g., caribou meat and seal meat must not touch, or be cooked together)

## 6. COUNTER-ARGUMENTS AND SCHOLARLY DEBATE

| Claim | Supporting Evidence | Counter-Evidence | Assessment |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| Inuit shamanism is part of a Siberian continuum | Linguistic, archaeological, and ethnographic connections; Beringia crossing | 5,000+ years of independent development; significant divergence | **Tier 1** — historical connection certain; extensive independent evolution also certain |
| Sedna myth is purely "religious" | Central to spiritual practice and worldview | Sedna myth also encodes practical ecological knowledge (sustainable harvest) | **Both** — inseparable spiritual-ecological system |
| Inuit had no formal religion | No temples, priests, scriptures, organizational structure | Angakkuq tradition, taboo system, cosmology = religion by any functional definition | **Misleading** — definition problem, not absence of religion |
| Qaumaniq is supernatural | Shaman's description of "inner light," seeing through bodies | May describe heightened perceptual awareness from sensory deprivation/fasting | **Tier 2** — phenomenologically real experience, mechanism debated |
| Colonialism destroyed Inuit spirituality | Residential schools, missionization, legal prohibition of shamanism | Traditions persist in private; active revitalization since 1990s | **Tier 1** — severe damage, Tier 2 — not total destruction |
