## QUICK SUMMARY

The **circumpolar world** — the vast band of Arctic and subarctic territory stretching from Scandinavia across Siberia to Alaska, Canada, and Greenland — is home to indigenous peoples whose spiritual traditions represent some of humanity's **oldest continuous shamanic practices** (→ K15). Among these, the **Sami** (historically called "Lapps," now considered pejorative) of northern Scandinavia and the Kola Peninsula occupy a unique position: they are **Europe's only indigenous Arctic people**, with a history of occupation stretching back at least 10,000 years. The Sami **noaidi** (shaman) used the **runebomme** (shaman drum) — an oval frame drum painted with cosmological maps showing the three-layered universe (upper world of gods, middle world of humans, lower world of the dead) — as a tool for **divination**, **healing**, and **spirit flight**. Through rhythmic drumming, joik singing, and controlled trance, the noaidi's soul would leave the body and journey between cosmic realms to negotiate with spirits, retrieve lost souls, or divine the location of game animals. This tradition was systematically destroyed during the **17th-18th century Christianization campaigns**, when missionaries and colonial authorities **confiscated and burned approximately 70+ known drums** (only ~71 survive in museums today), executed noaidis, and suppressed Sami religious practice. Yet the circumpolar shamanic complex — shared in structural form across Sami, Siberian (Evenki, Chukchi, Yakut, Buryat), and Inuit/Yupik traditions — preserves elements that may represent the **oldest layer of human religious experience**, potentially continuous with Upper Paleolithic practices (30,000+ years ago → C34). The **Bear Ceremony** (found among Sami, Ainu, Siberian peoples, and Native Americans) and the concept of **animal masters** protecting game species connect these Arctic traditions to a pan-human heritage of respectful reciprocity between humans and the animal world (→ B12).

## 1. THE CIRCUMPOLAR WORLD

### 1.1 Circumpolar Peoples [5/5 sources]

| People | Region | Language Family | Key Features |
|--------|--------|----------------|--------------|
| **Sami** | Northern Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia (Kola Peninsula) | Uralic (Finno-Ugric) | Reindeer pastoralism; ~80,000-100,000 people today; only indigenous Arctic people of Europe |
| **Evenki** (Tungus) | Siberia (vast range) | Tungusic | The word "shaman" derives from Evenki *šamán*; wide-ranging reindeer herders |
| **Chukchi/Koryak** | Northeast Siberia | Chukotko-Kamchatkan | Coastal (sea mammal hunting) and reindeer herding variants; dual shamanism traditions |
| **Yakut** (Sakha) | Central/Eastern Siberia | Turkic | Horse and cattle culture in extreme cold; elaborate shamanic cosmologies |
| **Inuit/Yupik** | Alaska, Canada, Greenland | Eskimo-Aleut | Angakkuq (shaman); sea mammal hunting; Sedna (sea goddess) mythology |
| **Ainu** | Northern Japan (Hokkaido), Sakhalin, Kuriles | Ainu (language isolate) | Bear ceremony (iyomante); "sending the gods" rituals; possible circumpolar connections |
| **Various Siberian peoples** | Ket, Selkup, Nenets, Nganasan, Khanty, Mansi, Buryat | Multiple families | Each with distinct shamanic traditions sharing structural features |

### 1.2 Environmental Factors [4/5 sources]

| Factor | Influence on Spirituality |
|--------|--------------------------|
| **Extreme seasons** | 24-hour darkness (winter) and 24-hour light (summer) → profound psychological impact; sacralization of light/dark cycles |
| **Aurora borealis** | Northern lights interpreted as spirits of the dead dancing, messages from ancestors, cosmic phenomena with spiritual significance |
| **Sparse population** | Isolation → intimate human-nature relationship; each person must be spiritually competent; shaman serves dispersed communities |
| **Animal dependency** | Complete reliance on animals (reindeer, seal, whale, fish) → animals must be spiritually respected; hunting is a spiritual act |
| **Ice and transformation** | Seasonal freeze/thaw as metaphor for death/rebirth; ice as boundary between worlds (water world below) |

## 2. SAMI RELIGION AND THE NOAIDI

### 2.1 Sami Cosmology [5/5 sources]

| Realm | Description | Inhabitants |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **Upper World** (*báječálbmi*) | Sky realm; reached by the shaman's soul in upward flight | Beaivi (Sun); Mánnu (Moon); Dierpmis (thunder god, cf. Norse Thor); other celestial beings |
| **Middle World** (*dálvvedis*) | The human world; shared with animals, plants, and land spirits | Humans; animals with their own perspectives; sieidi (sacred stones/land features) |
| **Lower World** (*jábmiid áibmu*) | World of the dead; accessed downward (through water, earth, or specific sites) | Jábmiidáhkká (goddess of the dead); ancestors; sometimes described as reversed version of middle world |

### 2.2 The Noaidi [5/5 sources]

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Selection** | Often inherited; sometimes called through dreams, illness (shamanic crisis), or unusual signs at birth |
| **Training** | Apprenticeship with elder noaidi; learning drum use, joik, plant lore, negotiation with spirits |
| **Spirit helpers** | Each noaidi had personal spirit helpers — often animal forms (bird, fish, reindeer) that served as vehicles for soul flight |
| **Trance technique** | Rhythmic drumming on runebomme; joik singing; sometimes aided by Amanita muscaria mushroom (debated; see §6); the noaidi's body appeared lifeless while the soul traveled |
| **Functions** | Divination (finding game, predicting weather, identifying thieves); healing (soul retrieval, spirit extraction); guiding the dead; conflict mediation |
| **Gender** | While most documented noaidis were male, evidence suggests women also served as spiritual practitioners; pre-Christian gender flexibility likely suppressed under Christianity |

### 2.3 Sacred Sites — Sieidi [4/5 sources]

- **Sieidi** (also seita, siedi): Sacred natural features — unusually shaped rocks, prominent hills, specific lakes or waterfalls — believed to house powerful spirits
- Offerings made at sieidi: reindeer antlers, fat, blood, fish
- Each siida (Sami community) had its own sacred sites
- Many sieidi were **destroyed or Christianized** during mission campaigns
- Some have been reclaimed by modern Sami for ceremonial use

## 3. SHAMAN DRUM AND JOIK

### 3.1 The Runebomme (Shaman Drum) [5/5 sources]

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Construction** | Oval frame drum made from birch or pine; reindeer hide stretched over frame; may be bowl-shaped (southern Sami) or frame-type (northern Sami) |
| **Painted cosmology** | The drum head is painted with a **cosmological map**: typically 3 horizontal zones (upper/middle/lower worlds) with gods, animals, humans, buildings, sun symbols, the world tree, and hunting/fishing scenes |
| **Divination pointer** | A small object (triangular piece of bone horn, metal ring bundle, or similar) placed on the drum head; as the drum is beaten, the pointer moves across the painted surface; its resting position over specific symbols provides the answer |
| **Sound** | Beaten with a T-shaped hammer of reindeer antler; rhythmic patterns induce altered states in the noaidi and attendees |
| **Destruction** | 17th-18th century missionaries (Thomas von Westen, others) systematically confiscated and burned drums; possession became a criminal offense; some noaidis were executed |
| **Surviving drums** | ~71 drums survive in museums (Nordiska Museet, Stockholm; Tromsø Museum; British Museum; etc.); most in Scandinavian collections; active repatriation movement |

### 3.2 Joik (Yoik) [4/5 sources]

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Nature** | The joik is NOT a "song about" something — it IS the thing. One joiks a person, an animal, a landscape. The joik embodies the essence of its subject |
| **Structure** | Typically uses vowel sounds, syllables, and short melodic phrases; no fixed lyrics in the Western sense; highly personal; each person may have their own joik composed for them |
| **Function** | Spiritual communication; invoking spirits; honoring the dead; expressing relationships with landscape and animals; noaidi used joik to enter trance and direct soul flight |
| **Suppression** | Christian missionaries specifically targeted joik as "devil's music"; banned in many areas; survived in remote communities |
| **Revival** | Modern Sami artists (Mari Boine, Sofia Jannok, Wimme Saari) have revived and adapted joik for contemporary contexts; UNESCO intangible cultural heritage recognition |

## 4. SIBERIAN AND INUIT SHAMANISM

### 4.1 Comparative Circumpolar Shamanism [5/5 sources]

| Feature | Sami | Siberian (Evenki/Chukchi) | Inuit |
|---------|------|---------------------------|-------|
| **Shaman term** | Noaidi | Šamán (Evenki) → origin of "shaman" | Angakkuq |
| **Primary tool** | Drum (runebomme) | Drum (essential; elaborately decorated) | Drum (different construction; frame drum) |
| **Costume** | Less elaborate than Siberian (may have been pre-Christian) | Elaborate costume with metal pendants, fringes representing spirit helpers, iron mirrors; the costume IS a spirit body | No special costume typically |
| **Soul flight** | Central practice; noaidi travels in spirit form | Central practice; shaman rides spirit horse/reindeer to other worlds | Angakkuq descends to Sedna's undersea realm or ascends to moon |
| **Dismemberment vision** | Implied in initiation | Classic shamanic initiation: spirits disassemble the apprentice's body, clean the bones, reassemble with new organs/eyes | Similar initiatory visions of bodily transformation |
| **World tree/axis** | Present but less prominent than Siberian | Central concept: the shaman climbs the world tree (birch pole with notches) to reach upper realm | Absent or less prominent |
| **Spirit helpers** | Animal spirits; ancestral spirits | Animal spirits; ancestral shamans; specific beings (e.g., Evenki clan spirits) | Tuurngait (helping spirits); animal spirits |

### 4.2 Sedna — Inuit Sea Goddess [4/5 sources]

- **Sedna** (also Nuliajuk, Takánakapsâluk): Central deity of many Inuit groups
- Origin story: A young woman thrown from a boat by her father; her fingers cut off as she clings to the gunwale → her fingers become seals, walruses, and whales
- Lives at the bottom of the sea; controls all sea animals
- When taboos are broken, her hair becomes tangled/dirty and she withholds the animals
- The angakkuq must **descend to her domain**, **comb her hair** (she has no fingers), and **confess the community's sins** — then she releases the animals
- This narrative encodes the **reciprocal relationship** between humans and the animal world: human ethical behavior is linked to ecological sustainability

## 5. BEAR CULT

### 5.1 The Bear Ceremony Across Circumpolar Cultures [5/5 sources]

| Culture | Ceremony | Key Elements |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Sami** | Bear funeral (*bierajahttin*) | Bear killed with specific rituals; bones carefully preserved and buried in anatomical order; last meal of raw marrow; special songs; the bear's spirit is "sent home" to the mountain; hunters purify themselves afterward |
| **Ainu** (Hokkaido) | Iyomante ("sending away") | Bear cub captured, raised in the village (sometimes nursed by women), then ritually killed in a ceremony of great solemnity; the bear kamuy (god) is honored and sent back to the spirit world carrying gifts |
| **Khanty/Mansi** (Ob-Ugrians) | Bear festival | Multi-day festival with masked performances, songs, dances; bear bones carefully preserved; the bear is treated as a guest/honored visitor from the spirit world |
| **Evenki** | Bear hunt ritual | Bear addressed respectfully before and after killing; blame deflected ("the bow killed you, not I"); bones returned to forest in order |
| **Various Native American** | Bear ceremonialism | Widespread respect for bears; bear clans; bear medicine societies; Cherokee, Innu, and Northwest Coast traditions |

### 5.2 Significance [4/5 sources]

- The **circumpolar bear cult** may represent one of the **oldest continuous ritual traditions in human history**
- **Neanderthal bear bone arrangements** (Drachenloch Cave, Switzerland, ~75,000 BP) — though interpretation is debated — suggest possible Proto-bear-cult behavior
- Upper Paleolithic cave art features bears prominently (Chauvet Cave, ~36,000 BP)
- The bear is seen as the **closest animal to humans**: walks upright; omnivorous; protective of young; hibernates (= death and rebirth); enormous strength
- The bear ceremony represents **reciprocal killing**: you kill the bear's body, but honor its spirit so it will allow itself to be killed again → sustainability through spiritual ecology
- This contrasts sharply with industrial-era approaches to animals (→ B12)

## 6. COUNTER-ARGUMENTS AND SCHOLARLY DEBATE

| Claim | Supporting Evidence | Counter-Evidence | Assessment |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| Circumpolar shamanism represents the oldest layer of human religion | Structural similarities across circumpolar cultures; cave art evidence; bear cult continuities; Paleolithic context | Continuity claims are speculative without written records; modern circumpolar religions have been influenced by centuries of contact and change; projection of modern categories onto Paleolithic evidence | **Tier 2** — plausible hypothesis; direct continuity cannot be proven, but structural parallels are significant |
| Sami noaidis used Amanita muscaria mushroom | Some historical references; R. Gordon Wasson's influential theory; mushroom motifs on some drums | Direct evidence is sparse; most documented Sami trance used drumming alone; mushroom use may be Siberian rather than Sami; Wasson's theory has been criticized | **Tier 2-3** — possible use but poorly documented compared to Siberian cases; drumming was the primary technique |
| Sami drum cosmology maps real cosmic structures | Drums show consistent 3-layer universe; alignments with astronomical features; encoded ecological/calendrical information | The "cosmic map" may reflect taught tradition rather than direct perception; cultural transmission rather than independent discovery | **Tier 1-2** — drums clearly encode a systematic cosmology; whether this represents "reality" is a philosophical question |
| Bear ceremonialism demonstrates continuous tradition from Neanderthals | Drachenloch Cave bear bone arrangements; structural similarities over vast time spans | Drachenloch evidence is highly disputed (natural deposition vs. intentional arrangement); 75,000-year continuity is impossible to demonstrate | **Tier 3** — intriguing parallel; Neanderthal evidence is not conclusive; Paleolithic cave art connection is stronger but still inferential |
