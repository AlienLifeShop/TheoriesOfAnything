## QUICK SUMMARY

The **Caucasus region** — particularly **Georgia** (Sakartvelo) — preserves one of the world's most striking mythological parallels to Greek tradition: the **Amirani myth**, in which a hero who steals divine fire or knowledge is **chained to a mountain** while an eagle devours his liver. This directly mirrors the Greek **Prometheus** bound to the Caucasus (→ C18), raising questions about common origin or cultural transmission. The ancient kingdom of **Colchis** (western Georgia), destination of Jason and the Argonauts in their quest for the **Golden Fleece**, was a real metallurgical center where gold-panning with sheep fleeces was practiced. The broader Caucasian mythological complex — including the **Nart sagas** shared across Georgian, Ossetian, Circassian, and Abkhaz peoples — represents a distinctive cultural sphere bridging Indo-European, Near Eastern, and indigenous traditions.

## 1. VERIFIED CLAIMS (Tier 1 — Peer-Reviewed / Archaeological Record)

### 1.1 Colchis — Historical Kingdom and Metallurgical Center [5/5 sources]

- **Colchis** (Georgian: *Kolkheti*) occupied western Georgia's Black Sea coast, attested from the 13th century BCE
- Rich in **gold, copper, and iron** deposits — a genuine metallurgical center (→ J05)
- **Gold-panning using sheep fleeces**: Strabo (*Geography* 11.2.19) describes Colchians trapping alluvial gold in fleeces placed in streams
- This practice is the **most plausible origin** of the Golden Fleece legend — a real technology mythologized by the Greeks
- Archaeological sites: **Vani** (rich burials, Greek-Colchian hybrid culture), **Nokalakevi** (fortress identified with mythical Aia/Aeëtes's city)

### 1.2 Kartvelian Language Family — Linguistic Isolate [5/5 sources]

- The **Kartvelian** (South Caucasian) language family comprises Georgian, Mingrelian, Laz, and Svan
- It is a **linguistic isolate** — no demonstrated genetic relationship to Indo-European, Semitic, or Turkic families
- Georgian script (*mkhedruli*) dates to the 5th century CE; the older *asomtavruli* script possibly from the 3rd century BCE
- This linguistic uniqueness suggests **deep indigenous cultural continuity** predating Indo-European migrations

### 1.3 The Nart Sagas — Pan-Caucasian Epic Tradition [4/5 sources]

The Nart sagas are a cycle of heroic legends shared across multiple Caucasian peoples:

| People | Language Family | Key Nart Heroes |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Ossetian** | Indo-European (Iranian) | Soslan, Batraz, Satana |
| **Circassian** (Adyghe/Kabardian) | Northwest Caucasian | Sosruquo, Tlepsh (smith-god) |
| **Abkhaz** | Northwest Caucasian | Sasrykva |
| **Georgian** (Svan) | Kartvelian | Related but distinct cycle |
| **Chechen/Ingush** | Northeast Caucasian | Adapted versions |

- The sagas feature a **smith-god** (Tlepsh/Kurdalaegon) who forges heroes = direct parallel to Hephaestus/Vulcan
- **Batraz** (Ossetian): born from his father's back, tempered in fire, dies by throwing his sword into the sea → striking parallels to **King Arthur** (Excalibur) noted by Dumézil

## 2. CREDIBLE CLAIMS (Tier 2 — Academic / Debated but Supported)

### 2.1 Amirani — The Georgian Prometheus [4/5 sources]

The Amirani myth, recorded in multiple Georgian variants:
- **Amirani** is a culture hero, sometimes of **divine/semi-divine parentage** (son of a goddess and a hunter)
- He performs heroic deeds: **slaying monsters**, bringing knowledge or fire to humanity
- He **defies the supreme deity** (often identified as the Christian God in later versions)
- As punishment, he is **chained to a mountain** in the Caucasus
- An **eagle or vulture** gnaws at his liver/heart; the wound heals, and the torment repeats
- A faithful dog licks the chains to free him, but each year smiths **re-forge the chains** (in some versions, this is why smiths strike anvils on specific holy days)

### 2.2 Prometheus and Amirani — Relationship [4/5 sources]

The parallels are too precise to be coincidental:

| Motif | Greek Prometheus | Georgian Amirani |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|
| Crime | Stole fire from the gods | Defied divine authority / brought knowledge |
| Punishment | Chained to the Caucasus | Chained to a Caucasian mountain |
| Torment | Eagle eats liver daily | Eagle/vulture gnaws liver/heart |
| Regeneration | Liver regenerates nightly | Wound heals, torment repeats |
| Liberator | Heracles eventually frees him | Dog licks chains; awaits liberation |

- **Dumézil** (1930) argued the Amirani myth was the **original** from which Greeks borrowed the Caucasus setting
- **Alternative view**: both derive from a **common Caucasian-Anatolian substrate** predating both Greek and Kartvelian differentiation
- The Greek tradition **explicitly sets Prometheus in the Caucasus** — Aeschylus, *Prometheus Bound*

### 2.3 Georgian Pre-Christian Religion [3/5 sources]

- **Armazi** (supreme god at the capital Mtskheta) — possibly related to Aramazd/Ahura Mazda
- **Moon worship** and **stellar cults** attested in Georgian and Colchian religion
- **Sacred groves**, hilltop shrines, and **tree worship** documented by Georgian chronicles
- Conversion to Christianity under **St. Nino** (c. 337 CE) — one of the earliest Christian nations
- Many pre-Christian deities transformed into **saints** or **nature spirits** (*devi*, *kudiani*)

### 2.4 Medea — Historical Figure or Cultural Memory? [3/5 sources]

- **Medea** (Greek mythology): princess of Colchis, priestess of Hecate, sorceress who aids Jason
- In Georgian tradition, Medea is a **wise woman/healer** rather than a sorceress — reflecting local vs. Greek perspectives
- Her knowledge of **poisons and herbal medicine** may reflect Colchian pharmaceutical expertise
- The name *Medea* may derive from a root meaning "to plan/advise" (cf. Greek *mēdomai*) or from the Medes

## 3. SPECULATIVE CLAIMS (Tier 3 — Possible but Unverified)

### 3.1 Caucasus as Original Metallurgical Diffusion Center [2/5 sources]

- Some scholars propose the Caucasus (including Georgia) as **the origin point for bronze and iron smelting**
- Evidence: very early copper-arsenic bronze in the Caucasus (Kura-Araxes culture, ~3400–2000 BCE)
- The Chalybes (Black Sea metalworkers mentioned by Greeks) = possibly connected to early iron technology
- **Contested**: multiple independent invention of metallurgy is now considered more likely than single-source diffusion (→ J05)

### 3.2 Nart Sagas and Arthurian Legend [2/5 sources]

- **Georges Dumézil** and later **C. Scott Littleton & Linda Malcor** argued that the Ossetian Nart sagas are the **direct source** of Arthurian legends
- Key parallels: dying hero throws sword into water (Batraz/Excalibur); lady of the lake; round feast; magical cup (Nartamonga/Grail)
- The transmission vector: **Sarmatian/Alan** cavalry deployed by Rome to Britain (2nd–5th century CE)
- **Hotly debated**: many medievalists consider the Celtic and Christian origins of Arthurian legend sufficient

### 3.3 The Chained Hero as Seismic Mythology [2/5 sources]

- The Caucasus is **seismically active** — earthquakes are common; the region sits at the **Arabian-Eurasian plate boundary**
- The myth of a **giant or hero chained within a mountain** whose struggles cause earthquakes appears across the region
- Greek Typhon, Georgian Amirani, Armenian *vishap* traditions may all encode **geological observation**
- This pattern appears globally (Loki in Norse, Ruaumoko in Māori) — **convergent response** to seismicity?
- The Caucasus has experienced devastating historical earthquakes: Shamakhi (1667, 1859, 1902), Spitak (1988) — persistent seismicity would reinforce mythological explanations across millennia
- Some geomythology scholars propose that the **volcanic and geothermal** features of the Caucasus (hot springs, fumaroles) may have inspired both the fire-theft and chained-hero motifs — the mountain literally breathes fire

## 4. DUBIOUS CLAIMS (Tier 4 — No Credible Source)

### 4.1 Colchis as a Colony of Egypt [1/5 sources]

- Herodotus (*Histories* 2.104) claimed Colchians were an **Egyptian colony** based on dark skin, circumcision, and linen-weaving
- Modern genetics and archaeology **do not support** Egyptian colonization of the Caucasus
- The similarities Herodotus noted are either **superficial** or reflect independent development
- Assessment: **Tier 4** — ancient speculation, not confirmed by evidence

### 4.2 Golden Fleece as Extraterrestrial Technology [1/5 sources]

- Fringe claims that the Golden Fleece represents **alien technology** or a "power source"
- No textual or archaeological support whatsoever — the gold-panning explanation is simple and sufficient
- Assessment: **Tier 4** — pseudoscience
