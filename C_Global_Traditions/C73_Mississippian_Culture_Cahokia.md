## QUICK SUMMARY

Cahokia, located near present-day East St. Louis, Illinois, was the largest pre-Columbian settlement north of Mexico, reaching a peak population of 20,000 or more around 1050-1200 CE. The site features Monks Mound — the largest earthwork in the Americas at over 100 feet tall on a 14-acre base — along with more than 120 additional mounds, a timber circle solar observatory (Woodhenge), and a grand plaza larger than the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The broader Mississippian cultural tradition (800-1600 CE) extended across the southeastern and midwestern United States, marked by platform mound architecture, shell-tempered pottery, maize agriculture, and the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC), an iconographic tradition featuring the Birdman motif, copper plates, and engraved marine shell gorgets. The rapid rise and mysterious decline of Cahokia, along with evidence of ritual sacrifice and sophisticated astronomical alignment, make it one of the most significant and under-studied civilizations in world history.

## 1. VERIFIED CLAIMS (Tier 1 — Peer-Reviewed / Archaeological Record)

### 1.1 Cahokia as Major Urban Center [5/5 sources]
Archaeological excavation since the 1960s has demonstrated beyond dispute that Cahokia was a planned urban settlement of extraordinary scale. It covered approximately 6 square miles, with a core ceremonial precinct surrounded by residential neighborhoods. Population estimates range from 10,000-20,000 at its zenith (1050-1200 CE), with some scholars arguing for higher figures when satellite communities are included. This made it contemporary with — and comparable in population to — medieval London. UNESCO designated Cahokia Mounds a World Heritage Site in 1982.

### 1.2 Monks Mound — Largest Earthwork in the Americas [5/5 sources]
Monks Mound rises approximately 100 feet (30 m) in four terraces, with a base footprint of roughly 14 acres (over 950 feet long by 650 feet wide). Constructed in stages between approximately 900 and 1200 CE, it required an estimated 22 million cubic feet of earth, moved entirely by hand in woven baskets. Soil analyses reveal sophisticated engineering: different clay types were deliberately layered to manage drainage and structural stability, contradicting earlier assumptions of simple earthen piling.

### 1.3 Woodhenge — Solar Calendar [4/5 sources]
Warren Wittry identified a series of large post pits in the 1960s that formed timber circles west of Monks Mound. Designated "Woodhenge," at least five successive circles were built between 900-1100 CE, each consisting of red cedar posts arranged to mark solstice and equinox sunrise alignments as observed from a central observation post. This solar calendar provides direct evidence of Cahokian astronomical knowledge and ceremonial scheduling.

### 1.4 Platform Mound Architecture Across the Southeast [5/5 sources]
The Mississippian tradition is defined by flat-topped earthen platform mounds supporting timber structures (temples, chief's residences, charnel houses). Major sites include Moundville (Alabama), Etowah (Georgia), Spiro (Oklahoma), Angel Mounds (Indiana), and Winterville (Mississippi). Stratigraphic analysis confirms repeated cycles of construction, use, deconstruction, and rebuilding — suggesting mounds embodied cosmological renewal cycles.

### 1.5 Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC) Iconography [4/5 sources]
Marine shell gorgets, copper repoussé plates, and engraved ceramics found across Mississippian sites share a recognizable iconographic vocabulary: the Birdman figure (falcon warrior), the bi-lobed arrow, the forked eye motif, the cross-in-circle, and the chunkey player. Originally called the "Southern Cult," the SECC is now understood as a widespread religious-symbolic system rather than a single organized religion.

## 2. CREDIBLE CLAIMS (Tier 2 — Academic / Debated but Supported)

### 2.1 Cahokia's Political Organization [3/5 sources]
Whether Cahokia constituted a true "state" or a complex chiefdom remains debated. Timothy Pauketat argues for a centralized political authority approaching statehood, while others maintain it was a paramount chiefdom with fluctuating power. The discovery of Mound 72 — containing a mass burial of over 270 individuals, including sacrificial victims and high-status figures buried on a bed of 20,000 shell beads — supports significant social stratification and coercive power.

### 2.2 Cahokia's "Big Bang" (~1050 CE) [3/5 sources]
Around 1050 CE, Cahokia experienced a rapid transformation: population surged, monumental construction accelerated, and the site plan was reorganized around a new cosmological template. Pauketat has termed this the "Big Bang" of Cahokia — a deliberate refounding event possibly linked to a supernova observation (SN 1054, which created the Crab Nebula). The chronological correlation is suggestive but remains circumstantial.

### 2.3 Chunkey as Political-Ritual Tool [3/5 sources]
The stone disc game chunkey (or chungke) was far more than recreation. Ethnographic and archaeological evidence suggests it functioned as a mechanism for diplomacy, alliance-building, redistribution of wealth, and cosmological enactment. Chunkey stones have been found at sites hundreds of miles from Cahokia, suggesting the game spread with Cahokian influence.

### 2.4 The Black Drink Tradition [3/5 sources]
Chemical residue analysis of Cahokian beaker-style ceramics has confirmed the presence of caffeine from Ilex vomitoria (yaupon holly), the source of the "Black Drink." This emetic and stimulant beverage was used in purification rituals across the Southeast. Its presence at Cahokia — far north of the plant's natural range — demonstrates long-distance trade networks and shared ritual practice.

### 2.5 Causes of Cahokia's Decline [3/5 sources]
By 1300-1350 CE, Cahokia was largely abandoned. Proposed causes include environmental degradation (deforestation, flooding), climatic shifts (the onset of the Little Ice Age), political instability, warfare (a palisade wall was constructed around the central precinct ~1175 CE), and social disintegration. No single cause has been definitively established; the decline was likely multi-causal.

## 3. SPECULATIVE CLAIMS (Tier 3 — Possible but Unverified)

### 3.1 Cahokia's Connection to Mesoamerica [2/5 sources]
Certain Cahokian features — platform mounds, human sacrifice, a planned city layout around a central plaza, and the possible presence of cacao — have led some researchers to propose direct Mesoamerican influence. The Cahokia flint clay figurines show stylistic parallels with Mesoamerican traditions. However, no definitive Mesoamerican artifacts have been found at Cahokia, and the relationship remains hypothetical.

### 3.2 Cosmological Mapping of the City Plan [2/5 sources]
Some researchers propose that Cahokia's layout was a deliberate map of the cosmos — an Upper World (Monks Mound), Middle World (Grand Plaza), and Lower World (Mound 72 burials) reflecting widespread Mississippian cosmology. While architecturally suggestive, direct evidence of intentional cosmographic planning at the city scale is limited.

### 3.3 Oral Traditions and Cahokia's Memory [2/5 sources]
Several Indigenous oral traditions from the Southeast and Midwest contain references to a great city, a powerful ancient alliance, or a catastrophic dispersal event that may encode memories of Cahokia's rise and fall. The Dhegihan Siouan migration narratives and certain Osage traditions are candidates, but direct connection to Cahokia is unconfirmed.

## 4. DUBIOUS CLAIMS (Tier 4 — No Credible Source)

### 4.1 Non-Indigenous Construction
19th-century "Mound Builder myth" attributed mound construction to a lost white race, Israelites, or Atlanteans. This has been thoroughly debunked by over a century of archaeology. The mounds were built by the ancestors of historically known Indigenous peoples. The myth itself is a case study in racialized pseudoarchaeology (→ H01).

### 4.2 Ancient Alien Involvement
Claims that Cahokia's alignment and scale required extraterrestrial assistance have no evidentiary basis. The engineering, while impressive, is fully explicable through organized human labor, as demonstrated by experimental archaeology projects.
