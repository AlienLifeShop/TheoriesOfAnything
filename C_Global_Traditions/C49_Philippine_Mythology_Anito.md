## QUICK SUMMARY

The **Philippines** — an archipelago of 7,641 islands in Southeast Asia — possesses one of the richest and most diverse mythological traditions in the world, encompassing **hundreds of ethnolinguistic groups** (Tagalog, Visayan, Ifugao, T'boli, Manobo, Ilocano, and many more), each with distinct yet interconnected cosmologies. Pre-colonial Philippine religion centered on **anito** (ancestor spirits and nature spirits), **diwata** (nature deities and guardians), and the practice of spirit mediums called **babaylan** (or catalonan, balian) — predominantly **women** or gender-fluid individuals who served as healers, ritual leaders, and community spiritual authorities. The **babaylan** tradition represents one of the clearest examples of **female spiritual leadership** in ancient Southeast Asia, including recognized transgender/gender-variant practitioners called **asog** (also bayoguin or bayog). Spanish colonial conquest (1565–1898) systematically suppressed these traditions (→ H07), destroying sacred texts, demonizing the babaylan, and imposing Christianity — yet indigenous practices survived in syncretic forms and continue among groups like the **Lumad** (indigenous peoples of Mindanao) and various upland communities. Philippine mythology contains extraordinary **epic poetry** — including the **Hinilawod** of the Sulod people (28,340 verses, longer than the Iliad and Odyssey combined) — and a bestiary of supernatural beings (**aswang, kapre, tikbalang, duwende**) that continues to shape Filipino cultural identity.

## 1. OVERVIEW — PHILIPPINE INDIGENOUS SPIRITUALITY

### 1.1 The Austronesian Context [5/5 sources]

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Language family** | Austronesian — Philippines is near the origin point of the Austronesian expansion (~3000 BCE from Taiwan) |
| **Ethnolinguistic groups** | 175+ distinct groups; 120+ languages |
| **Pre-colonial writing** | Baybayin (Tagalog), Buhid, Hanunó'o, Tagbanwa — Indic-derived scripts (some still in use) |
| **Religious framework** | Animist — spirits inhabit all things; ancestor veneration; divine intermediaries |
| **Colonial disruption** | Spanish conquest (1565) → mass Christianization; indigenous practices declared "paganism" and "witchcraft" |
| **Survival** | Indigenous traditions persist among Lumad, Cordillera peoples, some lowland syncretic practices |

### 1.2 Diversity of Traditions [4/5 sources]

| Region | People(s) | Key Feature |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Luzon highlands** | Ifugao, Bontoc, Kalinga, Ibaloi | Rice terrace rituals; mumbaki priests; elaborate death rituals |
| **Tagalog lowlands** | Tagalog | Bathala (supreme deity); diwata; catalonan priestesses |
| **Visayas** | Visayan (Cebuano, Hiligaynon, Waray) | Babaylan tradition; Hinilawod epic; elaborate anito worship |

## 2. CREATION NARRATIVES AND COSMOLOGY

### 2.1 Major Creation Stories [5/5 sources]

| Tradition | Narrative |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Tagalog** | **Bathala** (supreme god) created the world; the sea and sky fought; a bird (Sarimanok) caused them to make peace; the first humans, **Malakas** ("Strong") and **Maganda** ("Beautiful"), emerged from a split bamboo |
| **Visayan** | The sky god **Kaptan** and sea goddess **Maguayan** married their children; from the union of beings came **Sicalac** (first man) and **Sicavay** (first woman), floating on the sea; a kite bird pecked open the bamboo releasing them |
| **Ifugao** | **Kabunian** (sky god) and **Bugan** — the first couple; creation through dialogue and partnership |
| **T'boli** | **D'wata** (supreme being) created the world; **S'fedat** wove the universe on a cosmic loom |
| **Manobo** | **Magbabaya** (supreme deity) created the world and humans from his own body |
| **Ilocano** | **Biag ni Lam-ang** — the hero born speaking, who avenges his father and marries Ines Kannoyan |

### 2.2 Cosmological Structure [4/5 sources]

Many Philippine traditions envision a **multi-layered cosmos**:

| Layer | Name (varies by group) | Inhabitants |
|-------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Upper world** | Kahilwayan / Skyworld | Supreme deities, ancestor spirits, celestial beings |
| **Middle world** | Kalibutanon / Earth | Humans, diwata, nature spirits |
| **Lower world** | Sulad / Underworld | The dead, chthonic beings, some diwata |

The **multi-layered structure** parallels Siberian (→ C46), Norse (→ A12), and Mesoamerican (→ A13) cosmic geographies.

## 3. THE SPIRIT WORLD — ANITO, DIWATA, AND ENGKANTO

### 3.1 Anito — Ancestor Spirits [5/5 sources]

**Anito** (also anitu, nanito) is the broad term for spirits — particularly ancestor spirits:
- Every person who dies becomes an anito
- Powerful ancestors become protective anito who guard their descendants
- Anito are **fed** through offerings (food, alcohol, betel nut) and **consulted** through ritual
- Neglecting anito brings illness, misfortune, crop failure
- The anito cult is the **foundation** of Philippine indigenous religion

### 3.2 Diwata — Nature Spirits and Deities [5/5 sources]

| Being | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Diwata** | Nature spirits/deities associated with specific places (mountains, rivers, forests, trees); derived from Sanskrit *devata* (divine being) |
| **Engkanto/Encanto** | Enchanted beings — beautiful, invisible humanoids living in mounds, old trees, or invisible villages; can enchant humans → B13 parallel |
| **Kapre** | Giant tree-dwelling being; smokes huge cigars; mostly benign but territorial |
| **Tikbalang** | Horse-headed humanoid; leads travelers astray in forests; wearing clothing inside out breaks its spell |
| **Duwende** | Mound-dwelling small beings (cf. dwarves); can be helpful or harmful → B13 |
| **Aswang** | Shape-shifting creature — most feared being in Philippine folklore; vampiric/ghoulish; targets pregnant women |
| **Manananggal** | Self-segmenting creature — upper body flies at night seeking prey; vinegar and garlic repel it |
| **Tiyanak** | Demonic baby spirit; lures people with crying sounds; possibly a spirit of unbaptized/aborted children |

### 3.3 The "Tabi-Tabi Po" Tradition [4/5 sources]

Filipinos traditionally say **"Tabi-tabi po"** ("Excuse me, please step aside") when passing through natural areas — a request for permission from invisible diwata and engkanto to pass through their territory. This practice — still widely observed — reflects the **animist foundation** of Filipino culture even among nominally Christian populations (→ P11).

## 4. THE BABAYLAN — SPIRIT MEDIUMS AND HEALERS

### 4.1 Role and Authority [5/5 sources]

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Gender** | Predominantly **female**; also **asog/bayoguin** — male-bodied individuals who lived as women and held high spiritual authority |
| **Functions** | Healer, diviner, spirit medium, ritual leader, midwife, judge, historian, poet |
| **Training** | Called by spirits (often through illness/crisis → shamanic initiation parallel → C46); apprenticeship under elder babaylan |
| **Authority** | In pre-colonial society, babaylan held authority **equal to or exceeding** that of the datu (chief) |
| **Spirit contact** | Entered trance states to communicate with anito and diwata; used drumming, chanting, dance → K15 |

### 4.2 The Asog — Gender-Variant Spiritual Practitioners [4/5 sources]

Spanish colonial accounts describe the **asog** (Visayan) or **bayoguin** (Tagalog):
- Male-bodied individuals who dressed as women and served as babaylan
- Held in **high respect** — not marginalized
- Functioned as spiritual intermediaries between genders (cf. Two-Spirit traditions in Americas; hijra in India)
- Spanish colonizers were horrified and specifically targeted them for elimination
- Antonio de Morga (1609): "They were regarded among the natives as priests and more respected than the babaylan"

### 4.3 Colonial Destruction (→ H07) [5/5 sources]

| Colonial Action | Effect |
|----------------|--------|
| **Demonization** | Babaylan labeled as "witches" and "servants of the devil" |
| **Execution/persecution** | Many babaylan killed, imprisoned, or forced to convert |
| **Text destruction** | Baybayin texts on bamboo/bark destroyed; Spanish deliberately burned indigenous records |
| **Forced conversion** | Mass baptism campaigns; indigenous ceremonies criminalized |
| **Rebranding** | Some babaylan practices survived within Catholic folk practice (fiestas, faith healing, Santa Niño devotion) |
| **Result** | One of the most comprehensive destructions of an indigenous knowledge system in Southeast Asian history |

## 5. EPIC LITERATURE — HINILAWOD AND OTHERS

### 5.1 Major Philippine Epics [5/5 sources]

| Epic | People | Length | Content |
|------|--------|--------|---------|
| **Hinilawod** (Tales from the Mouth of the Halawod River) | Sulod (Visayan) | **28,340 verses** (longer than Iliad + Odyssey) | Three demigod brothers — Labaw Donggon, Humadapnon, Dumalapdap — quest for brides; battles with monsters; journeys to sky-world |
| **Biag ni Lam-ang** (Life of Lam-ang) | Ilocano | ~422 stanzas | Hero born speaking; avenges father's death; marries Ines Kannoyan; dies and is resurrected |
| **Darangen** | Maranao (Mindanao) | 17 cycles | Maranao epic cycle; Islamic-influenced; pre-colonial roots; UNESCO Masterpiece of Intangible Heritage (2005) |
| **Ulahingan** | Livunganen-Arumanen Manobo | Multi-day chanting | Creation, cultural heroes, spirit world journeys; performed by chanters over multiple nights |
| **Hudhud** | Ifugao | 200+ narratives | Chanted during rice harvest; UNESCO Masterpiece (2001); women's vocal tradition |
| **Tuwaang** | Bagobo | Multiple episodes | Hero's journeys across cosmic layers; oral performance tradition |

### 5.2 Hinilawod — Detail [4/5 sources]

Transcribed by **F. Landa Jocano** (1960s–1970s) from the chanting of **Ulang Udig** (a Sulod chanteuse):
- Takes **three full nights** to chant in its entirety
- Preserved entirely by **oral tradition** — no written version existed before Jocano's transcription
- Features **female characters** with as much agency as male heroes — Anggoy Ginbitinan, Nagmalitong Yawa
- Includes journeys between the three cosmic worlds (skyworld, middleworld, underworld)
- One of the **longest epics** recorded from any oral tradition worldwide

## 6. COUNTER-ARGUMENTS AND SCHOLARLY DEBATE

| Claim | Supporting Evidence | Counter-Evidence | Assessment |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| Pre-colonial Philippines had sophisticated literate cultures | Baybayin scripts; epic literature; Laws of Maragtas | Scripts were simple syllabaries; literacy was not universal; most texts were on perishable materials (lost) | **Tier 1-2** — literate traditions existed but scope is debated |
| Babaylan tradition represents female spiritual authority | Spanish colonial accounts confirm; parallel to SE Asian gender-inclusive spiritual systems | Colonial accounts may have exaggerated or misunderstood; not all regions had female-dominant priesthood | **Tier 1** — female/gender-diverse spiritual leadership well-attested |
| Spanish colonization destroyed an entire knowledge system | Baybayin texts burned; babaylan persecuted; cosmologies suppressed | Some knowledge survived in folk practice; oral traditions continued in highlands; syncretic Catholicism preserved elements | **Tier 1** — destruction was massive, though not total |
| Philippine mythology is connected to broader Austronesian/Polynesian tradition | Linguistic connections; motif parallels (trickster heroes, cosmic layers, ancestor spirits); Austronesian migration model | Each Philippine group developed independently over millennia; lumping them together obscures local complexity | **Tier 1** — Austronesian connection clear; internal diversity also genuine |
| Aswang beliefs reflect pre-colonial spiritual concepts | Widespread across Philippines; structural parallels to SE Asian vampire-spirits | May be partly colonial-era development; used to demonize babaylan (accused of being aswang by missionaries) | **Tier 2** — some elements pre-colonial, some evolved during colonial period |
