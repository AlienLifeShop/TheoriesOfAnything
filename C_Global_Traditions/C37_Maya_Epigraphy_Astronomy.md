## QUICK SUMMARY

The Maya civilization developed one of the most sophisticated writing systems in the pre-Columbian Americas — a mixed logographic-syllabic script that recorded history, astronomy, mythology, and ritual on stone monuments, ceramics, and bark-paper codices. Their **Long Count calendar** tracked time across millions of years, their **Venus tables** predicted planetary positions with errors of less than one day in 500 years, and their mathematical system independently invented the concept of **zero** centuries before its adoption in Europe. The 20th-century decipherment of Maya hieroglyphs — one of the great intellectual achievements of modern scholarship — revealed a complex civilization of warring city-states, divine kings, and an astronomical science embedded within a richly mythological worldview. Maya timekeeping, with its nested cycles and cataclysmic era transitions, provides critical parallels to cyclical destruction narratives found worldwide.

## 1. HISTORY OF DECIPHERMENT

### 1.1 Early Attempts and the "Alphabet" Problem [4/5 sources]

Bishop Diego de Landa's *Relación de las cosas de Yucatán* (1566) recorded a supposed Maya "alphabet" (the **Landa alphabet**) from a native informant — but fundamentally misunderstood the writing system. When Landa asked for the Maya equivalent of the Spanish letter "b," his informant drew the syllabic sign for the *sound* /be/, not a letter. This confusion derailed decipherment for nearly 400 years.

Key milestones:

| Date | Scholar | Contribution |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1566 | Diego de Landa | Recorded (misidentified) "alphabet" |
| 1832 | Constantine Rafinesque | Identified bar-and-dot numerals |
| 1880s | Ernst Förstemann | Decoded Dresden Codex calendar/astronomical tables |
| 1952 | **Yuri Knorosov** | Proposed phonetic-syllabic reading; proved Maya glyphs recorded language |
| 1960 | **Tatiana Proskouriakoff** | Demonstrated historical (not purely mythological) content at Piedras Negras |
| 1973 | **First Palenque Round Table** | Linda Schele, Peter Mathews — decoded Palenque dynasty in single session |
| 1980s–2000s | David Stuart et al. | Rapid acceleration; ~85% of known glyphs now readable |

### 1.2 Knorosov's Breakthrough [5/5 sources]

Soviet linguist **Yuri Valentinovich Knorosov** (1922–1999) proposed in 1952 that Maya hieroglyphs operated as a **mixed logographic-syllabic system** — exactly as Landa's data predicted if properly understood. Working from published photographs in Leningrad (never visiting a Maya site), Knorosov demonstrated that:

- Individual signs could represent either **whole words** (logograms) or **syllables** (syllabograms)
- Syllabic signs followed a consonant-vowel (CV) pattern
- Words could be spelled logographically, syllabically, or in combination
- The Landa "alphabet" was actually a **syllabary** — the informant had given syllabic readings

His work was initially rejected by the dominant Western Mayanist **J. Eric S. Thompson**, who insisted the glyphs were purely ideographic. Knorosov's vindication came gradually through the 1960s–70s, culminating in full acceptance by the 1980s. Today, approximately **85% of known Maya glyphs** can be read with confidence.

### 1.3 The Proskouriakoff Revolution [4/5 sources]

**Tatiana Proskouriakoff** (1909–1985) demonstrated in 1960 that the inscriptions at Piedras Negras recorded **historical events** — births, accessions, conquests, and deaths of real rulers — rather than purely mythological or calendrical content. Her identification of "emblem glyphs" (city-name titles) and event glyphs transformed Maya epigraphy from astronomy-focused interpretation to a full historical discipline.

## 2. THE MAYA WRITING SYSTEM

### 2.1 Script Structure [5/5 sources]

Maya hieroglyphic writing is one of only a handful of independently invented writing systems in human history (alongside Sumerian cuneiform, Egyptian hieroglyphs, Chinese characters, and possibly the Indus Valley script).

**Structural features:**
- **Mixed logographic-syllabic:** Signs represent either whole morphemes or CV syllables
- **Glyph blocks:** Signs arranged in square blocks, read left-to-right, top-to-bottom in paired columns
- **Polyvalence:** A single sign can have multiple readings; a single word can be written multiple ways
- **~800 distinct signs** documented, with ~500 in regular use during the Classic period
- Script used to write **Ch'olan** (primarily Classic Ch'olti'an) during the Classic period

### 2.2 Surviving Texts [4/5 sources]

The vast majority of Maya texts were destroyed during the Spanish conquest — Bishop Diego de Landa infamously burned thousands of codices at Maní in 1562. Only **four codices** survive:

| Codex | Location | Date | Content |
|-------|----------|------|---------|
| **Dresden Codex** | Saxon State Library | ~11th–12th c. CE | Venus tables, eclipse tables, almanacs — finest surviving |
| **Madrid Codex** | Museum of the Americas | ~15th c. CE | Ritual almanacs, agriculture |
| **Paris Codex** | Bibliothèque nationale | ~15th c. CE | Katun prophecies, zodiac-like constellation band |
| **Grolier Codex** (Codex Maya de México) | National Museum, Mexico City | ~13th c. CE | Venus table fragment — authenticity confirmed 2018 |

Additionally, thousands of **stone inscriptions** (stelae, lintels, panels, altars, stairways) and **ceramic texts** survive from the Classic period (250–900 CE).

### 2.3 What the Texts Record [4/5 sources]

Maya inscriptions document:
- **Royal history:** Births, accessions, wars, alliances, sacrifices, deaths of kings
- **Calendrical records:** Dates in multiple calendar systems, period-ending ceremonies
- **Astronomical observations:** Eclipse records, planetary positions
- **Mythology:** Creation narratives, patron deity identities
- **Ritual:** Bloodletting and auto-sacrifice events, vision quest records
- **Tribute and economy:** Warfare captive counts, tribute relationships

## 3. MAYA CALENDAR SYSTEMS

### 3.1 The Three Interlocking Calendars [5/5 sources]

The Maya operated three simultaneous calendar systems:

**1. Tzolk'in (260-day Sacred Calendar)**
- 13 numbers × 20 day-names = 260 unique day positions
- Possible origins: human gestation period (~266 days), or combination of 13 major joints × 20 digits
- Used for divination, ritual scheduling, personal destiny
- Still in active use by K'iche' and other Maya communities today

**2. Haab' (365-day Solar Calendar)**
- 18 months × 20 days = 360 days + 5 "unlucky" days (Wayeb')
- Solar year approximation (actual solar year ≈ 365.2422 days)
- Agricultural and civic scheduling

**3. Calendar Round (52-year cycle)**
- Combination of Tzolk'in and Haab' — a unique pair repeats every **18,980 days** (≈52 solar years)
- Endpoint ceremonies included extinguishing all fires and "New Fire" drilling (parallels Aztec ceremony → C36)

### 3.2 The Long Count [5/5 sources]

For recording historical dates beyond the 52-year Calendar Round, the Maya developed the **Long Count** — a continuous day-count from a mythological creation date:

**Structure (modified base-20):**

| Unit | Days | Approximate |
|------|------|-------------|
| K'in | 1 | 1 day |
| Winal | 20 | 20 days |
| Tun | 360 | ~1 year |
| K'atun | 7,200 | ~20 years |
| B'ak'tun | 144,000 | ~394 years |

- Creation date: **4 Ahau 8 Kumk'u** = August 11, 3114 BCE (GMT correlation)
- 13 B'ak'tun cycle = 1,872,000 days ≈ 5,125 years
- The completion of the 13th B'ak'tun fell on **December 21, 2012** (see §6)

### 3.3 Mathematics: Zero and Vigesimal System [4/5 sources]

The Maya independently invented **positional notation with zero** — a shell-shaped glyph (𝟎) representing "completion" of a place value. Their vigesimal (base-20) system used only three symbols:

- **Dot** = 1
- **Bar** = 5
- **Shell** = 0 (zero/completion)

This mathematical sophistication enabled calculations spanning millions of years. At Quiriguá, Stela D records a date reaching back **400 million years** — a number that suggests the Maya conceived of time on genuinely cosmic scales.

## 4. ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE

### 4.1 Venus Observations [5/5 sources]

The **Dresden Codex Venus Table** (pages 24, 46–50) tracks the synodic period of Venus with extraordinary precision:

| Parameter | Maya Value | Modern Value | Error |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Venus synodic period | 584 days | 583.92 days | 0.08 days |
| 5 Venus cycles | 2,920 days | 2,919.6 days | 0.4 days |
| Correction over 481 years | Applied | — | ~2 hours cumulative |

The Maya tracked Venus through its full cycle: **morning star** (236 days) → superior conjunction (90 days) → **evening star** (250 days) → inferior conjunction (8 days). Venus as morning star was associated with **warfare** — wars were deliberately timed to Venus events ("Star War" events in inscriptions).

### 4.2 Eclipse Prediction [4/5 sources]

The Dresden Codex **Eclipse Table** (pages 51–58) contains a table covering 405 lunations (≈33 years) that identifies potential eclipse windows. The table:
- Predicts solar eclipse possibilities with **~90% accuracy**
- Groups eclipse seasons into intervals of 177 or 148 days
- Demonstrates understanding of eclipse periodicity without (apparently) knowing the heliocentric model
- Shows awareness of the **saros-like cycle** (though structured differently from the Babylonian saros)

### 4.3 Lunar Series and Other Observations [4/5 sources]

Classic Maya inscriptions frequently include a **Lunar Series** — supplementary glyphs recording:
- Moon age (days since new moon) at the date of the inscription
- Lunation number within a cycle of 6 lunations
- Whether the current lunation was 29 or 30 days
- This data implies a **lunar synodic period** calculation of 29.53020 days (modern value: 29.53059)

Other potential astronomical content:
- **Mars tables** in the Dresden Codex (debated)
- Possible **zodiacal constellation band** in the Paris Codex
- Architectural alignments to solstice, equinox, and zenith passage at Chichén Itzá, Uxmal, and other sites (→ D19)

### 4.4 The Milky Way and Ecliptic [3/5 sources]

Maya cosmology identified the **Milky Way** as a cosmic road, crocodilian being, and/or the canoe of the Maize God paddled across the sky. At certain times of year, the Milky Way appears to "stand up" from the horizon like a world tree — a phenomenon the Maya may have identified with the **Wakah-Chan** (Raised-up Sky, World Tree).

The intersection of the Milky Way and the ecliptic near Sagittarius — the "dark rift" or *Xibalba be* ("Road to Xibalba/Underworld") — was cosmologically significant, though the extent of its calendrical role is debated (see §6).

## 5. COSMOLOGY AND CREATION NARRATIVES

### 5.1 The Popol Vuh Creation Account [4/5 sources]

The **Popol Vuh** (→ A13), recorded in K'iche' Maya in the mid-16th century, preserves the most complete Maya creation narrative:

**Four creation attempts:**
1. **Earth and animals** — animals cannot praise the gods; deemed insufficient
2. **Mud people** — dissolve and cannot hold form
3. **Wood people** — function but lack hearts/minds; destroyed by flood and animated objects
4. **Maize people** — humanity's successful creation from white and yellow maize

The Hero Twins (**Hunahpu** and **Xbalanque**) descend to **Xibalba** (the underworld), defeat the Lords of Death through cleverness and self-sacrifice, and resurrect as the Sun and Moon (or Venus). Their father, the **Maize God** (Hun Hunahpu), is resurrected from the underworld — a death-and-rebirth narrative paralleling Osiris (Egyptian), Dumuzi (Sumerian), and Dionysus (Greek).

### 5.2 Classic Period Creation: The Three-Stone Hearth [4/5 sources]

Inscriptions at **Quiriguá** (Stela C) and **Palenque** (Temple of the Cross) record the creation event of **4 Ahau 8 Kumk'u** (August 11, 3114 BCE):

- Three stones were set in place, forming the **cosmic hearth** (identified with the three stars of Orion's Belt or the triangle of stars near Alnitak)
- The **Wakah-Chan** (World Tree/Milky Way) was raised
- The sky was "lifted" from the sea
- The **Cosmic Crocodile** (or Starry Deer Crocodile) was split to create earth and sky

This cosmogony involves simultaneous celestial and terrestrial events — the creation of the physical cosmos and the establishment of its astronomical order are the same act.

### 5.3 Divine Kingship and Sacred Landscape [4/5 sources]

Maya kings (*k'uhul ajaw* — "divine lords") served as **cosmic mediators** between human, celestial, and underworld realms:

- **Bloodletting rituals:** Kings and queens pierced tongues, earlobes, or genitals with stingray spines, drawing blood onto bark paper burned to summon **vision serpents** — conduits to ancestors and patron deities
- **Vision serpents** depicted in inscriptions as double-headed serpent bars or rearing serpent figures with ancestor faces emerging from their mouths (→ B01, B06)
- **Temple pyramids** as cosmic mountains (→ D05), with interiors as cave-entrances to the underworld
- **Ball courts** as portals to Xibalba; the ball game as cosmological drama

## 6. COUNTER-ARGUMENTS AND SCHOLARLY DEBATE

### 6.1 The 2012 Phenomenon — Claim vs. Evidence [5/5 sources]

**Claim (Tier 3–4):** The completion of the 13th B'ak'tun on December 21, 2012 marked an "end of the world," "galactic alignment," or "consciousness shift."

**Evidence against:**
- Only **one** ancient Maya inscription (Tortuguero Monument 6) references the 13.0.0.0.0 date — and its damaged text appears to describe a ritual, not an apocalypse
- The Maya conceived of **time beyond** 13 B'ak'tun: inscriptions at Palenque and Coba reference dates millions of years in the future
- "Galactic alignment" (Sun aligning with Milky Way dark rift at winter solstice) occurs over a **~36-year window**, not a single date, and is a modern construct not found in Maya texts
- No surviving Classic Maya text describes the rollover as destructive
- The phenomenon was primarily a product of **New Age appropriation** (José Argüelles, John Major Jenkins) rather than Maya scholarship

**Scholarly consensus:** The 13 B'ak'tun completion was likely viewed similarly to an odometer rolling over — a significant period-ending requiring ceremony, not an eschatological event.

### 6.2 Pre-Columbian Contact Claims [3/5 sources]

**Claim (Tier 3):** Maya astronomical knowledge demonstrates contact with Old World civilizations (Egypt, Babylon, China).

**Evidence assessment:**
- Maya mathematics, astronomy, and writing show **independent development** with no structural parallels to Old World systems
- The vigesimal system (base-20) differs fundamentally from Babylonian sexagesimal (base-60) or Egyptian decimal
- Writing system structure is entirely original; no glyph borrowing detected
- **However:** Some scholars note intriguing parallels in calendrical cycle lengths, flood mythology, and astronomical alignments that warrant further comparative study without implying direct contact

### 6.3 Astronomical Precision — How Did They Do It? [4/5 sources]

The accuracy of Maya Venus and eclipse tables is uncontested. The mechanism remains debated:
- **Empirical observation over centuries:** Systematic naked-eye records accumulated across generations at multiple observatory sites
- **Error correction:** Tables include built-in correction factors showing iterative refinement
- **Institutional memory:** Scribal schools and astronomical lineages at major centers (Copán, Palenque, Chichén Itzá) preserved and refined data
- No evidence of optical instruments, though specialized sight-lines through building apertures served as alignment tools
