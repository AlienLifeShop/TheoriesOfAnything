## QUICK SUMMARY

**Anatolia** (modern Turkey) is arguably the **single most important region** for understanding the origins of organized religion and goddess-worship in the Old World. The Neolithic settlement of **Çatalhöyük** (7500–5700 BCE) — one of the earliest known "cities" — yielded the iconic **seated goddess flanked by leopards**, widely regarded as the oldest anthropomorphic deity figure (though this identification is debated). The site's **bull symbolism** (bucrania embedded in walls, bull imagery) connects to later Minoan bull-cult traditions (→ C42). Millennia later, the Phrygian goddess **Cybele** — the "Mountain Mother" — became one of the ancient world's most powerful deities, adopted by Rome in 204 BCE as **Magna Mater** (carried to Rome as a **black meteorite**). Her devotees, the **Galli** priests, practiced ritual self-castration — a form of radical bodily transformation in service of the divine. The earlier site of **Göbekli Tepe** (→ D01, ~9500 BCE) may represent an even more ancient expression of the same Anatolian religious impulse, pushing organized worship back to the very dawn of the Neolithic.

## 1. VERIFIED CLAIMS (Tier 1 — Peer-Reviewed / Archaeological Record)

### 1.1 Çatalhöyük — The Neolithic Settlement [5/5 sources]

- **Location**: Konya Plain, central Anatolia (Turkey)
- **Dates**: ~7500–5700 BCE (East Mound), ~6300–5500 BCE (West Mound)
- **Scale**: up to **8,000 inhabitants** at peak — one of the largest Neolithic settlements known
- **Architecture**: densely packed mudbrick houses with **no streets** — access via roof ladders; no public buildings or obvious temples
- **Burials**: beneath house floors — the living dwelt **directly above their dead**
- **Art**: wall paintings (hunting scenes, vultures, geometric patterns), plastered bull skulls (bucrania), figurines
- Excavated by **James Mellaart** (1961–1965) and **Ian Hodder** (1993–2018); now a **UNESCO World Heritage Site**

### 1.2 The "Seated Goddess" Figurine [5/5 sources]

- A **fired-clay figurine** (~17 cm) depicting a corpulent female figure seated on a throne/chair **flanked by two felines** (leopards or lions)
- Found by Mellaart in a grain bin (Level II, ~6000 BCE)
- Widely reproduced as the **"Mother Goddess of Çatalhöyük"**

**The Debate**:
- **Mellaart's interpretation**: this is a **mother goddess** giving birth while enthroned — the supreme deity of the settlement
- **Hodder's revision**: Çatalhöyük had **no single dominant goddess cult**; the figurines are diverse (male, female, animal, abstract); only a small percentage are "goddess-like"
- Current consensus: the seated figure is **important** but should not be used to project a unified "goddess religion" onto the entire site (→ C23 for broader debate)

### 1.3 Bull Symbolism at Çatalhöyük [5/5 sources]

- **Bucrania** (plastered bull skulls) were **embedded in walls and pillars** of houses
- Bull horns arranged in rows, tiers, and clusters — sometimes with multiple skulls in a single room
- Wall paintings depict **bull-baiting/hunting** scenes — human figures surround a large bull
- **Bull-related imagery** is the **most common animal symbolism** at the site
- Connection to later traditions:
  - Minoan **bull-leaping** and bull sacrifice (→ C42)
  - Near Eastern bull-god traditions (Baal as bull, Egyptian Apis bull)
  - The bull as symbol of **male power, fertility, and danger** across the ancient world

### 1.4 Cybele / Magna Mater — Historical Attestation [5/5 sources]

- **Cybele** (Greek Κυβέλη; Phrygian Matar Kubileya; Latin Magna Mater): Anatolian mother goddess
- Earliest attestation: Phrygian inscriptions (~8th–7th century BCE) associate **Matar** ("Mother") with mountains and sacred doors
- Possible precursor: **Kubaba**, a Hurrian/Neo-Hittite goddess of Carchemish (→ C58), whose name may have evolved into "Cybele"
- Greek adoption: cult center at **Pessinus** (Galatia); temple at **Sardis**; entered Athens by 5th century BCE
- **Roman adoption (204 BCE)**: during the Second Punic War, the Sibylline Books instructed Rome to bring the Magna Mater from Pessinus
  - The goddess was embodied in a **black stone** (possibly a meteorite — *lapis niger*)
  - She was installed on the Palatine Hill in her own temple (dedicated 191 BCE)

## 2. CREDIBLE CLAIMS (Tier 2 — Academic / Debated but Supported)

### 2.1 The Galli — Priests of Cybele [4/5 sources]

The **Galli** (singular *gallus*) were Cybele's most distinctive devotees:
- They underwent **voluntary self-castration** (*eviratio*) during ecstatic religious frenzy, typically on the **Dies Sanguinis** ("Day of Blood," March 24)
- After castration, they adopted **feminine dress, jewelry, and cosmetics** — living as a distinct gender
- They performed ecstatic rituals with **drums, cymbals, and frenzied dancing** (*tympanum*, *cymbalum*)
- Roman sources (Catullus, Ovid, Lucian) describe the Galli with **fascination and horror** — they represented a **transgressive liminality** that unsettled Roman gender norms
- The mythological basis: **Attis**, Cybele's consort, castrated himself under a pine tree — the Galli reenacted this founding act
- Modern interpretation: the Galli represent an ancient form of **ritual gender transformation** — connecting to broader questions of sacred androgyny and third-gender traditions worldwide

### 2.2 Cybele's Ritual Calendar — Hilaria [3/5 sources]

The Roman festival cycle of Magna Mater (March 15–28):

| Date | Event | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| March 15 | *Canna intrat* | Reed-bearing procession |
| March 22 | *Arbor intrat* | Pine tree (Attis's tree) carried to temple |
| March 24 | *Dies Sanguinis* | Day of Blood — Galli self-mutilation, mourning for Attis |
| March 25 | *Hilaria* | Day of Joy — Attis's resurrection/return celebrated |
| March 27 | *Lavatio* | Ritual washing of Cybele's image |

- The cycle of **death and resurrection** (Attis dies → Attis returns → rejoicing) parallels other Near Eastern dying-and-rising god patterns (Osiris, Tammuz/Dumuzi, Baal → C28)
- **Date proximity to Easter**: the Hilaria falls near the vernal equinox — early Christian polemicists saw Cybele/Attis worship as a **demonic parody** of the Resurrection

### 2.3 Anatolian Religious Continuity — Çatalhöyük to Cybele? [3/5 sources]

The question of continuity across **five millennia**:
- Çatalhöyük: ~7500–5700 BCE (female figurines, bull symbolism, leopard imagery)
- Cybele: ~8th century BCE – 4th century CE (enthroned goddess, lion-flanked, mountain mother)

| Element | Çatalhöyük | Cybele |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Enthroned female | Seated goddess flanked by leopards | Cybele enthroned, flanked by lions |
| Feline companions | Leopards | Lions |
| Bull symbolism | Bucrania, bull imagery | Bull sacrifice (*taurobolium*) |
| Mountain/earth association | Settlement built on mound | "Mountain Mother" (*Matar Kubileya*) |

- **Mellaart** argued for direct continuity — the Çatalhöyük goddess "is" proto-Cybele
- **Hodder and others** reject this: a 5,000-year gap with no connecting evidence; Çatalhöyük's religion was likely **very different** from Phrygian Cybele worship
- Prudent assessment: there may be a **broad Anatolian tradition** of female-deity veneration, but direct lineage is unproven

## 3. SPECULATIVE CLAIMS (Tier 3 — Possible but Unverified)

### 3.1 Göbekli Tepe as Proto-Anatolian Religion [3/5 sources]

- **Göbekli Tepe** (→ D01, ~9500 BCE): monumental T-pillars with animal carvings, predating Çatalhöyük by 2,000+ years
- Some scholars propose that Göbekli Tepe, Çatalhöyük, and later Anatolian goddess worship represent **stages in a single religious evolution**
- The Göbekli Tepe pillars feature **vultures, snakes, foxes, boars** — no obvious "goddess" imagery
- If connected, the tradition would span **9,000+ years** — one of the longest religious continuities in human history
- Assessment: tantalizing but unverifiable — the gaps are too large and the material evidence too ambiguous

### 3.2 The Taurobolium — Bull-Blood Baptism [2/5 sources]

- The **taurobolium**: a ritual in late Cybele worship (2nd–4th century CE) where a bull was slaughtered on a perforated platform and the initiate bathed in its **blood** below
- Described by Prudentius (*Peristephanon* 10, ~400 CE) in vivid, hostile detail
- Some scholars link this to Mithraic **tauroctony** (bull-slaying) — both may derive from an Anatolian bull-sacrifice tradition
- Whether the taurobolium was an ancient rite or a **late innovation** is debated — earliest attestation is 2nd century CE

### 3.3 Black Meteorite — Baetyl Tradition [2/5 sources]

- The Magna Mater was embodied in a **black stone** brought to Rome — likely a **meteorite** (iron-nickel meteorites are black and heavy)
- This connects to the broader Near Eastern **baetyl** (sacred stone) tradition:
  - The Ka'aba's **Black Stone** in Mecca
  - Nabataean betyls (→ C87)
  - Ugaritic and Phoenician sacred pillars
- Meteorites as "stones from heaven" = **divine objects** in multiple ancient cultures
- Whether these diverse stone-veneration traditions share a common origin or are independent responses to the same phenomenon is unclear

## 4. DUBIOUS CLAIMS (Tier 4 — No Credible Source)

### 4.1 Çatalhöyük as a Matriarchal Paradise [1/5 sources]

- Popularized by Mellaart and amplified by **Gimbutas** (1989): the claim that Çatalhöyük was a **peaceful, matriarchal, goddess-worshipping** society before IE "patriarchal" invasion
- Hodder's excavations (1993–2018) found **no evidence of matriarchy**: burials show **no gender-based hierarchy**; violence marks appear on both male and female skeletons
- The figurines are diverse — not exclusively female, not exclusively "goddesses"
- Assessment: **Tier 4** — romantic projection onto archaeological evidence (→ C23 for full debate)

### 4.2 Cybele Worship as Surviving Atlantean Religion [0/5 sources]

- Fringe claims linking Cybele/Anatolian goddess worship to a lost **Atlantean mother-cult**
- No evidence whatsoever — Anatolia's religious development is explicable from local Neolithic evolution
- Assessment: **Tier 4** — pseudohistory
