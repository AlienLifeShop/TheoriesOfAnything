## QUICK SUMMARY

The **Baltic peoples** — Lithuanians, Latvians, and the now-extinct Old Prussians — represent the **last pagan culture in Europe**, with Lithuania not formally Christianized until **1387 CE** (the latest in Europe by over two centuries). This late conversion preserved an extraordinarily archaic **Indo-European religious system** that comparative linguists consider **the closest living relative** of Vedic Sanskrit religion (→ A20). The thunder god **Perkūnas** is a direct cognate of Vedic Parjanya, Slavic Perun, Norse Thor, and Celtic Taranis (→ C56). The **Romuva** tradition — sacred oak groves with **eternal fire** tended by virgin priestesses (*vaidilutės*) — parallels both Druidic groves (→ C34) and Roman Vestal Virgins. The sky god **Dievas/Dievs** preserves the oldest form of the IE divine name (*\*Deywós* → Latin *Deus*, Sanskrit *Deva*, Greek *Zeus*). The Lithuanian-Latvian **dainos** (traditional songs) — with over **1.5 million** recorded variants — constitute the **largest oral tradition** in Europe and encode cosmological, ethical, and ritualistic knowledge spanning millennia.

## 1. VERIFIED CLAIMS (Tier 1 — Peer-Reviewed / Archaeological Record)

### 1.1 Late Christianization — Last Pagan Europeans [5/5 sources]

- **Lithuania** officially converted to Christianity in **1387** under Grand Duke Jogaila (Jagiełło)
- This makes Lithuania the **last European state** to abandon official paganism
- The Old Prussians (Baltic, not Germanic) were forcibly Christianized by the **Teutonic Knights** (1230–1283) — effectively a crusade-genocide
- **Latvia** Christianized during the **Northern Crusades** (1198–1290) — Teutonic Order and Livonian Brothers of the Sword
- Even after formal conversion, **pagan practices persisted** for centuries — Jesuit reports from the 16th–17th century document ongoing tree worship, fire rituals, and polytheistic beliefs

### 1.2 The Baltic-Vedic Linguistic Connection [5/5 sources]

Baltic languages (Lithuanian and Latvian) are **the most archaic surviving Indo-European languages**:

| Lithuanian | Sanskrit | Latin | English | Meaning |
|-----------|----------|-------|---------|---------|
| *Dievas* | *Devá* | *Deus* | (God) | Sky god/deity |
| *ugnis* | *agní* | *ignis* | — | Fire |
| *vyras* | *vīrá* | *vir* | — | Man/hero |
| *sūnus* | *sūnú* | — | *son* | Son |
| *avis* | *ávi* | *ovis* | *ewe* | Sheep |

- Antoine Meillet (1908): "Anyone wishing to hear how Indo-Europeans spoke should come and listen to a Lithuanian peasant"
- This linguistic conservatism **extends to mythology** — Baltic deities preserve PIE deity-names more transparently than any other living tradition

### 1.3 The Dainos — Oral Tradition Archive [4/5 sources]

- **Dainos** (Lithuanian) / **Dainas** (Latvian): traditional folk songs encompassing all aspects of life — birth, marriage, death, seasons, gods, ethics
- The **Latvian dainas** collection: over **1.5 million** text variants recorded, making it the **largest folk song archive** in Europe
- Compiled primarily by **Krišjānis Barons** (1835–1923): 217,996 texts organized in his famous "cabinet of dainas" (*Latvju dainas*, 6 volumes, 1894–1915)
- Lithuanian dainos similarly extensive — hundreds of thousands of variants
- UNESCO recognized the **Baltic Song and Dance Celebration** tradition (2003, 2008)
- The dainos preserve **mythological references** that predate Christianity — Saulė (sun), Mēness/Mėnulis (moon), Laima (fate), Perkons/Perkūnas (thunder)

## 2. CREDIBLE CLAIMS (Tier 2 — Academic / Debated but Supported)

### 2.1 Perkūnas — The Thunder God [5/5 sources]

**Perkūnas** (Lithuanian) / **Pērkons** (Latvian) is the most prominent Baltic deity:
- Name from PIE *\*Perkwunos* ("the Striker") — cognate with Slavic Perun, Vedic Parjanya, Norse Fjörgynn, Celtic Hercynia
- **Functions**: thunder, lightning, rain, justice, oaths, purification
- **Sacred tree**: the **oak** — Perkūnas strikes oaks with lightning (a natural phenomenon given oaks' height and bark conductivity)
- **Weapon**: thunderbolt, stone axe, or hammer — "thunder-stones" (*Perkūno akmenys*) found after lightning strikes (actually Neolithic stone tools found in plowed fields) were considered sacred
- The **Perkūnas vs. Velnias** opposition mirrors the Slavic **Perun vs. Veles** pattern exactly (→ C56, C84):
  - Velnias (Lithuanian devil/underworld god) steals cattle
  - Perkūnas pursues and strikes Velnias with lightning
  - Velnias hides behind trees, stones, humans
  - Rain is released upon Velnias's defeat

### 2.2 Dievas — The Sky Father [4/5 sources]

- **Dievas** (Lithuanian) / **Dievs** (Latvian): the supreme sky god
- Name directly preserves PIE *\*Deywós* ("sky one") → Latin *Deus*, Greek *Zeus* (gen. *Dios*), Sanskrit *Devá*, Old Norse *Týr*
- In Baltic tradition, Dievas is **more remote** than Perkūnas — a **deus otiosus** (remote supreme god) while Perkūnas handles active weather/justice functions
- Dievas appears in dainos as a **farmer-god**: he plows the sky, tends cosmic fields — a strikingly rustic depiction of the supreme deity
- The word *dievas* became the generic Lithuanian word for "God" after Christianization (= exact parallel to *deus* in Latin)

### 2.3 Romuva — Sacred Groves and Eternal Fire [4/5 sources]

- **Romuva** (also Romovė): the chief sacred site of the **Old Prussians**, described by Peter of Dusburg (1326)
- Features: a **sacred oak** at the center, an **eternal fire** (*šventoji ugnis*) maintained continuously, and a **high priest** (*Krivis/Krivė Krivaitis*)
- **Vaidilutės** (Lithuanian) / **vaidilutes**: virgin priestesses who tended the sacred fire
- Parallels:
  - Roman **Vestal Virgins** tending the sacred flame of Vesta
  - Celtic **Druidic groves** and Brigid's eternal flame at Kildare (→ C34)
  - Zoroastrian **fire temples** and eternal flame tradition
- The Romuva site was **destroyed** during the Teutonic crusade; its exact location is uncertain (likely near modern Kaliningrad)

### 2.4 The Solar Mythology — Saulė, Mėnulis, and the Celestial Wedding [4/5 sources]

Baltic mythology preserves a distinctive **solar narrative**:

| Deity | Domain | Gender | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Saulė / Saule** | Sun | **Female** | Sun as mother/bride — rides a chariot |
| **Mėnulis / Mēness** | Moon | **Male** | Moon as groom — unfaithful to Saulė |
| **Aušrinė / Auseklis** | Morning Star (Venus) | Female/Male | Dawn figure — IE *\*Hausos* (→ Greek Eos, Latin Aurora) |

- **The Celestial Wedding**: Saulė and Mėnulis marry, but Mėnulis is unfaithful (with Aušrinė); Perkūnas **punishes** Mėnulis by cutting him with a sword — explaining the moon's phases
- This myth preserves the PIE **Dawn goddess** motif (→ A20 §Uṣas) in remarkable detail

### 2.5 Laima — The Fate Goddess [3/5 sources]

- **Laima** (Lithuanian and Latvian): goddess of **fate, birth, and fortune**
- She determines each person's destiny at **birth** — appears at the cradle
- Parallel to Norse **Norns**, Greek **Moirai**, Slavic **Rozhanitsy**
- Often appears as a **triad** (Laima, Dēkla, Kārta in Latvian) — fate as three-fold
- Deeply embedded in the dainos — Laima is invoked more frequently than almost any other deity
- Survives in Christian-era folklore as **Laima** (unchanged) — testament to her cultural persistence

## 3. SPECULATIVE CLAIMS (Tier 3 — Possible but Unverified)

### 3.1 Baltic Religion as "Fossil" of PIE Religion [3/5 sources]

- The argument: due to geographic **marginality** and **late Christianization**, Baltic religion preserves PIE religious structures more faithfully than any other tradition
- Supporting evidence: Perkūnas/Dievas names, celestial mythology, and three-function structure all closely match reconstructed PIE religion
- **Counter-argument**: no tradition is a "fossil" — Baltic religion also evolved, borrowed, and innovated over three millennia
- Lithuanian scholars (Greimas 1992) argue for a structured **semiotic mythology** that is uniquely Baltic, not simply "preserved PIE"

### 3.2 Žemyna — Earth Goddess and Pre-IE Substrate [2/5 sources]

- **Žemyna** (Lithuanian, from *žemė* "earth"): the earth goddess, directly cognate with Vedic *Kṣam* and Greek *Chthōn*
- Some scholars propose that Baltic earth-goddess worship (Žemyna, Žemėpatis) may preserve **pre-Indo-European** agricultural goddess traditions absorbed by incoming IE speakers (→ F09)
- The emphasis on **earth kissing**, libations poured directly onto the ground, and reverence for snakes as earth-guardians is notably intense in Baltic tradition
- Whether this represents **pre-IE substrate** or simply an archaic IE element is unresolved

### 3.3 The Krivė and Priestly Hierarchy [2/5 sources]

- The **Krivė Krivaitis** ("chief priest") apparently held authority over both Baltic and some Slavic pagan communities
- Peter of Dusburg (1326) compared the Krivė's authority to that of the **Pope** — a supreme religious figure
- If accurate, this would suggest an organized **priestly interstate** structure unusual for pre-state European paganism
- **Skepticism**: Christian chroniclers may have projected their own **hierarchical model** onto Baltic religion

## 4. DUBIOUS CLAIMS (Tier 4 — No Credible Source)

### 4.1 Lithuania as Preserver of "Original Aryan Religion" [1/5 sources]

- 19th and early 20th century claims that Lithuanian paganism was the **direct survival** of "original Aryan religion"
- While Lithuanian DOES preserve archaic IE features, the concept of a single "original Aryan religion" is **academically discredited**
- This framing was weaponized by **racial ideologues** and must be rejected
- Assessment: **Tier 4** — outdated racialist framework

### 4.2 Modern Romuva as Unbroken Tradition [1/5 sources]

- The modern **Romuva movement** (Lithuanian neopaganism, founded 1967/revived 1988) claims continuity with ancient Baltic religion
- While it draws on authentic folklore and linguistic evidence, it is a **modern reconstruction**, not an unbroken tradition
- No continuous institution links modern Romuva to pre-1387 practice
- Assessment: **Tier 4** in its continuity claims; Tier 2 in its use of authentic source material
