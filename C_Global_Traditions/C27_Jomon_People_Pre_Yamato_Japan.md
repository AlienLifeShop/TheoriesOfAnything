**Key Thesis:** The Jōmon people of Japan sustained one of the world's longest continuous cultural traditions (~14,000+ years), producing the world's oldest known pottery, complex ritual art including possible serpent symbolism, and challenging standard archaeological models of the relationship between pottery, agriculture, and civilization.

## 1. THE JŌMON PERIOD — OVERVIEW

### 1.1 Chronological Framework

The Jōmon period is one of the **longest continuous cultural traditions** in world archaeology, spanning roughly **16,500 years** — from the end of the Pleistocene to the arrival of rice-farming Yayoi migrants.

**Conventional Dating (calibrated radiocarbon):**
- **Incipient Jōmon:** ~16,500 – 10,000 BP (~14,500 – 8,000 BCE)
- **Initial Jōmon:** ~10,000 – 7,000 BP (~8,000 – 5,000 BCE)
- **Early Jōmon:** ~7,000 – 5,500 BP (~5,000 – 3,500 BCE)
- **Middle Jōmon:** ~5,500 – 4,500 BP (~3,500 – 2,500 BCE)
- **Late Jōmon:** ~4,500 – 3,300 BP (~2,500 – 1,300 BCE)
- **Final Jōmon:** ~3,300 – 2,300 BP (~1,300 – 300 BCE)

These dates, based on AMS radiocarbon dating with calibration, place the beginning of the Jōmon tradition in the late Upper Paleolithic — making it contemporary with the Magdalenian cave art culture in Europe (Lascaux, Altamira) and predating the Neolithic revolution in the Near East by several millennia.

**Naming:**
- "Jōmon" (縄文) means **"cord-marked"** — referring to the distinctive technique of pressing twisted cords into wet clay to create decorative patterns on pottery
- The term was coined by American zoologist Edward S. Morse (1838-1925), who excavated the Ōmori shell mound near Tokyo in 1877 — the first scientific archaeological excavation in Japan
- Morse described the pottery as "cord marked" (*jōmon*), and the name stuck

### 1.2 The Oldest Pottery in the World

The most extraordinary aspect of the Jōmon period is its **pottery** — among the oldest in the world.

**Key Findings:**
- **Ōdai Yamamoto I site** (Aomori Prefecture, northern Honshu): plain pottery fragments radiocarbon dated to **~16,500 BP** (calibrated)
  - Excavated by Taniguchi Yasuhiro (1998, 1999)
  - AMS dates from carbonized material adhering to the sherds
  - These are among the oldest dated pottery fragments in the world
- **Xianrendong Cave** (Jiangxi, China): pottery dated to ~20,000 BP (Wu et al., 2012, *Science*) — currently the world's oldest, predating Jōmon
- **Yuchanyan Cave** (Hunan, China): ~18,000 BP pottery
- **Amur River region** (Russian Far East): ~16,000 BP pottery
- **Jōmon pottery** remains among the top 3-4 oldest pottery traditions globally

**Why This Matters:**
The standard archaeological model (the "Neolithic Package") assumed that pottery was invented **because of agriculture** — sedentary farmers needed storage and cooking vessels. Jōmon pottery demolishes this assumption:
- Jōmon people were **hunter-gatherer-fishers** for most of their history — NOT farmers
- They made pottery for at least **10,000 years** before any evidence of plant cultivation
- This proves that pottery could emerge from a **complex foraging economy**, not just farming
- Implications: the "Neolithic Revolution" model (V. Gordon Childe, 1936) was too simplistic — cultural complexity doesn't require agriculture

**Early Pottery Function:**
- Lipid residue analysis (Craig et al., 2013, *Nature*): Jōmon pottery was used primarily for **processing marine and freshwater animals** — cooking fish, shellfish, marine mammals
- Pottery allowed boiling and stewing — extracting more nutrition from food, especially from foods that are toxic or indigestible raw (acorns, certain shellfish)
- This cooking technology may have enabled population growth and semi-sedentary settlement without agriculture

### 1.3 Population and Settlement

**Population Estimates:**
- Koyama Shuzo (1978) estimated Jōmon population peaked at approximately **250,000-300,000** during Middle Jōmon (~5,500-4,500 BP)
- Population was concentrated in **eastern Japan** (Tohoku, Kanto, Chubu) — the Pacific coast provided rich marine resources
- Western Japan had lower Jōmon population — this region would later be the entry point for Yayoi rice farmers
- Population declined significantly during Late and Final Jōmon — possibly due to cooling climate and reduced nut/marine productivity

**Settlement Patterns:**
- Semi-sedentary villages, often circular in arrangement
- Typically located near coasts, rivers, or lakeshores — maximizing access to marine, freshwater, and terrestrial resources
- Pit-houses (tate-ana-jūkyo): semi-subterranean dwellings with wooden post frames and thatch or bark roofs
- Villages often occupied for centuries — some for millennia (Sannai-Maruyama: ~1,700 years)
- Seasonal movement: some groups moved between coastal (summer) and inland (winter) camps

### 1.4 Subsistence — Not Quite Farmers, Not Simple Foragers

Jōmon subsistence challenges the binary classification of "hunter-gatherer" vs. "farmer":

**Marine Resources:**
- Fish (salmon, tuna, sea bream, flatfish), shellfish (clams, oysters, abalone), marine mammals (sea lions, dolphins, small whales)
- Evidence from **shell mounds (kaizuka)** — massive refuse heaps of discarded shells, bones, and artifacts
- Over 2,000 kaizuka documented across Japan
- The Kasori Shell Mound (Chiba Prefecture, ~5,000-3,000 BP): one of the largest, designated a National Historic Site

**Terrestrial Resources:**
- Deer and wild boar: primary terrestrial protein sources
- Nuts: chestnuts, walnuts, acorns, horse chestnuts — critical caloric staples
  - Acorn processing: leaching tannins through repeated soaking — technologically demanding
  - Chestnut cultivation: evidence of managed chestnut groves at Sannai-Maruyama
- Wild plants: yams, lily bulbs, burdock root, various edible greens
- **Proto-agriculture:** evidence of managing plant resources — clearing forest to encourage nut-bearing trees, cultivating bottle gourds, hemp, lacquer trees, and possibly buckwheat and barnyard millet

## 2. JŌMON MATERIAL CULTURE

### 2.1 Pottery Phases and Styles

Jōmon pottery evolved through distinct phases, from simple utilitarian vessels to some of the most elaborate ceramic art in the prehistoric world:

**Incipient Jōmon (~16,500-10,000 BP):**
- Simple, rounded-bottom pots with minimal decoration
- Cord-marking begins — the defining Jōmon technique
- Small vessels, possibly used for boiling nuts or shellfish
- Sites: Ōdai Yamamoto I (Aomori), Fukui Cave (Nagasaki)

**Initial Jōmon (~10,000-7,000 BP):**
- Flat-bottomed vessels appear — more stable, larger capacity
- Pointed-bottom vessels also common — possibly for cooking over open fires
- Decoration becomes more elaborate: cord-marking, shell impressions, stick impressions
- Maritime adaptation increasingly important as sea levels rise (Jōmon Transgression)

**Early Jōmon (~7,000-5,500 BP):**
- Growing variety of vessel forms: deep pots, shallow bowls, jars with spouts
- Vegetation and animal imagery begins appearing on vessels
- Regional stylistic differentiation becomes pronounced

**Middle Jōmon (~5,500-4,500 BP) — The Artistic Apex:**
- **Kaen-doki (flame-style pottery, 火焔土器):** the most spectacular Jōmon ceramics
  - Elaborate flame-like projections extending from vessel rims
  - Found primarily in **Niigata Prefecture** (Umataka site, Sasayama site)
  - The Kaen-doki from the Sasayama site (Tokamachi, Niigata) was designated a **National Treasure of Japan** in 1999 — the first Jōmon artifact to receive this status
  - Extremely labor-intensive: individual vessels may represent hundreds of hours of work
  - No known practical function for the elaborate projections — likely ritual or prestige items
  - Some scholars interpret the "flames" as representing serpent or dragon imagery (see §4)
- Middle Jōmon also sees the peak of dogū production (see below)
- Largest settlement sizes, most elaborate material culture

**Late Jōmon (~4,500-3,300 BP):**
- Thin-walled, refined pottery — technically more sophisticated than Middle Jōmon but less dramatically decorated
- Increased variety of specialized vessel forms (pouring vessels, incense burners, lamps)
- Population decline begins

**Final Jōmon (~3,300-2,300 BP):**
- Continued refinement; some mainland influences detectable
- Kamegaoka-style pottery (Aomori): elaborate, finely made vessels with lacquer finish
- Gradual transition toward Yayoi-style pottery in western Japan

### 2.2 Dogū Figurines — Enigmatic Clay Figures

**Dogū** (土偶, literally "clay figure") are among the most famous and enigmatic artifacts of the Jōmon period.

**Basic Facts:**
- Small clay figurines, typically 10-30 cm tall (some miniatures under 5 cm)
- Produced primarily during Middle to Final Jōmon (~5,500-2,300 BP)
- Over **18,000** dogū have been recovered from sites across Japan
- Most are female (identifiable from breasts, swollen abdomens, wide hips)
- Most are found **deliberately broken** — usually fragmented at joints (arms, legs, head)
- Regional styles reflect local artistic traditions

**Major Dogū Types:**

**Heart-shaped face dogū (ハート形土偶):** Heart-shaped face, elaborate hairstyle or headdress. Middle Jōmon, found in Gunma and surrounding regions.

**Hollow dogū (中空土偶):** Large, hollow-bodied figurines with intricate surface designs. One example from Hakodate (Hokkaido) designated a National Treasure.

**Horned-owl dogū (ミミズク土偶):** Owl-faced figurines. Final Jōmon, primarily in Kanto region.

**Shakōki-dogū (遮光器土偶, "goggle-eyed dogū"):**
- The most famous and controversial type
- Named for their enormous, exaggerated "goggle" eyes — resembling snow goggles (shakōki) used by Inuit peoples
- Elaborate surface decoration: lines, dots, raised ridges covering the entire body
- Most famous example: from Kamegaoka site (Aomori Prefecture, ~1000-400 BCE), now in the Tokyo National Museum
- These figurines have attracted **ancient astronaut** interpretations (see below)

**Academic Interpretation:**
- Most archaeologists interpret dogū as **fertility or healing figures:**
  - Female emphasis → possible connection to childbirth, fertility, or feminine divine principle
  - Deliberate breakage → possible "substitution magic" — breaking the figurine to "absorb" an illness or injury from a person, transferring damage to the figure
  - Some show evidence of "healed" breaks (refired after repair) — supporting the idea that breaking/repairing was part of their function
  - Burial contexts: sometimes found in graves, sometimes in middens, sometimes cached in pits
- **Ritual/shamanistic interpretation:** dogū as representations of spirit beings seen during altered states of consciousness
  - Connection to K16 (Entoptic Phenomena): some dogū surface designs resemble entoptic patterns (lattices, spiral, zigzag) seen during trance states

**Ancient Astronaut Interpretation (Tier 4):**
- **Vaughn Greene** (*Astronauts of Ancient Japan*, 1978): proposed that shakōki-dogū depicted **extraterrestrial visitors in space suits**
  - "Goggle eyes" = helmet visor
  - Surface decorations = space suit details (tubes, panels, seams)
  - Rounded bodies = pressurized suits
- This interpretation was popularized by Erich von Däniken and has been widely repeated in ancient astronaut literature
- **Academic assessment: rejected.** The shakōki-dogū:
  - Are clearly female (breasts visible)
  - Show Jōmon clothing/tattoo patterns on their surfaces
  - The "goggle" eyes may represent masks, face paint, or stylized eyes in the Jōmon artistic tradition
  - Are part of a continuous tradition of dogū production spanning millennia — there is no discontinuity suggesting "outside influence"
- However: the sheer strangeness of shakōki-dogū is genuinely remarkable, and their purpose remains debated even among mainstream archaeologists

### 2.3 Lacquerware — World's Oldest

**Lacquerware:**
- Jōmon people produced the **world's oldest known lacquer objects**
- Lacquer (urushi) is derived from the sap of the lacquer tree (*Toxicodendron vernicifluum*)
- **Kakinoshima B site** (Hakodate, Hokkaido): lacquered ornaments dating to **~9,000 BP** — the oldest known lacquerwork in the world
- Lacquer was used on combs, earrings, containers, and bows
- Colors: primarily red (iron oxide pigment) and black
- The lacquer tree was likely **cultivated** by Jōmon people — evidence of deliberate planting and management (Suzuki 2002)
- This represents sophisticated chemical knowledge: urushi must be processed carefully (exposure causes severe dermatitis), applied in thin layers, and cured in humid conditions

### 2.4 Stone Circles

Several Jōmon sites include stone arrangements interpreted as **ceremonial or astronomical**:

**Ōyu Stone Circles (Akita Prefecture):**
- Two stone circles: Manza ("Ten Thousand Seats") and Nonakado ("Field Inside")
- Approximately 5,000-4,000 BP (Late Jōmon)
- Manza: ~48m in diameter, consisting of multiple concentric rings of river cobbles
- A central sundial-like stone pillar at Nonakado
- Astronomical alignment proposed: possible solstice orientation (debated)
- Designated a **Special National Historic Site** of Japan

**Komakino Stone Circle (Aomori Prefecture):**
- ~4,000 BP (Late Jōmon)
- Approximately 35m in diameter
- Located on a hilltop overlooking the Tsugaru Plain
- Associated with pit burials and ritual deposits

**Isedotai Stone Circle (Akita Prefecture):**
- Four stone circles in proximity
- Major axis aligned to summer solstice sunset (reported by Akita Prefecture archaeological survey)
- Combined with the Ōyu circles — evidence of large-scale ceremonial landscape comparable to (though smaller than) European megalithic traditions

**Connection to D05 (Megalithic Engineering):**
- Jōmon stone circles are smaller than European megaliths (Stonehenge, Carnac, Göbekli Tepe) but demonstrate:
  - Communal labor organization
  - Possible astronomical observation
  - Ritual landscape design
  - Multi-generational use of sacred spaces
- In 2021, **"Jōmon Prehistoric Sites in Northern Japan"** (17 archaeological sites across Hokkaido and northern Tohoku) were inscribed as a **UNESCO World Heritage Site** — recognizing the exceptional nature of the Jōmon cultural tradition

### 2.5 Shell Mounds (Kaizuka)

**Shell mounds** are one of the most abundant Jōmon site types:
- Over **2,000** shell mounds documented across Japan
- Largest: Kasori Shell Mound (Chiba), Ubayama Shell Mound (Chiba), Hōshaku Shell Mound
- Not simply refuse heaps: also contain burials, ritual deposits, broken tools, dogū fragments
- Some shell mounds were used for **2,000+ years** of continuous deposition
- Faunal analysis from shell mounds provides rich data on Jōmon diet, seasonal movement, and environmental change
- First excavated scientifically by Edward Morse at Ōmori (1877)

## 3. SANNAI-MARUYAMA AND COMPLEX SOCIETY

### 3.1 The Discovery

**Sannai-Maruyama** (三内丸山遺跡) is the largest and most important Jōmon settlement ever discovered, located on the southwestern outskirts of Aomori City, Aomori Prefecture, northern Honshu.

**Discovery and Excavation:**
- The site was known from surface finds since the Edo period
- Major excavations began in **1992**, when construction of a new baseball stadium uncovered extensive remains
- The scale of the finds prompted the cancellation of the stadium project — the site was preserved
- Excavations continued through the 1990s and 2000s under the Aomori Prefectural Board of Education
- Now a **Special National Historic Site** and part of the UNESCO World Heritage "Jōmon Prehistoric Sites" inscription (2021)

### 3.2 Scope and Duration

**Occupation Period:** ~5,900-4,200 BP (~3,900-2,200 BCE) — approximately **1,700 years** of continuous settlement

**Site Size:**
- Approximately **35+ hectares** of archaeological deposits
- Hundreds of pit-houses (over 550 identified), storage pits, and burials
- Road structure: a 12-meter-wide road running ~420m through the center of the settlement
- Organized layout: residential areas, ritual areas, midden (refuse) areas, and burial zones spatially separated

### 3.3 Key Features

**The Six-Post Structure (大型掘立柱建物):**
- Six massive chestnut-wood post holes arranged in a 3×2 grid, spaced **4.2 meters apart**
- Each post hole approximately **2m deep and 2m in diameter**
- The posts themselves were approximately **1m in diameter** — enormous chestnut logs
- Reconstruction at the site shows a raised platform structure ~15m tall (height is conjectural)
- Function debated: watchtower? ritual platform? astronomical observatory? communal building?
- The standardized 4.2m spacing (approximately 14 Jōmon "feet"?) suggests a **measurement system**
- This implies a level of architectural planning and communal labor mobilization unexpected for "hunter-gatherers"

**Long Houses:**
- Several elongated structures, the largest approximately 32m × 10m
- These may have been communal buildings, assembly halls, or workshops
- Their existence implies organized communal activities at a settlement-wide scale

**Plant Cultivation Evidence:**
- DNA analysis of chestnut remains: **all chestnuts at the site are genetically similar** — indicating selective cultivation, not random gathering (Noshiro & Suzuki, 2004)
- Managed chestnut groves — the Jōmon inhabitants were practicing **tree cultivation** (arboriculture)
- Bottle gourd (*Lagenaria siceraria*): cultivated — originally a tropical plant, its presence at Sannai-Maruyama indicates long-distance plant transfer
- Hemp (*Cannabis sativa*): fiber evidence
- Lacquer tree (*Toxicodendron vernicifluum*): cultivated for lacquer production
- Burdock, elderberry, and other managed plants
- This constitutes **proto-agriculture** — not full-scale farming, but deliberate management of plant resources

**Long-Distance Trade:**
- **Obsidian** from Hokkaido (Shirataki/Oketo sources, ~300-700 km distant) and Nagano Prefecture (Wada-Tōge source, ~500 km)
- **Jade/jadeite** from Itoigawa (Niigata Prefecture, ~400 km) — prestige material
- **Amber** from Kuji (Iwate Prefecture, ~200 km)
- **Asphalt** from Akita Prefecture (~150 km) — used as adhesive for hafting tools
- These distances demonstrate extensive **exchange networks** linking distant Jōmon communities — not a characteristic of isolated, simple foraging bands

### 3.4 Challenging the "Simple Hunter-Gatherer" Label

Sannai-Maruyama forces a reconsideration of what "hunter-gatherer" means:

| Feature | "Simple" Hunter-Gatherer | Sannai-Maruyama |
|---------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| Settlement duration | Seasonal/short-term | 1,700 years continuous |
| Settlement size | Small band camps | 35+ hectares, hundreds of structures |
| Architecture | Temporary shelters | Monumental post structure, longhouses |
| Subsistence | Pure foraging | Proto-agriculture, managed forests |
| Trade | Local | Regional networks (300-700+ km) |
| Social organization | Egalitarian bands | Organized labor, planned settlement |
| Measurement | None | Standardized 4.2m spacing |

This challenges the linear model of cultural evolution (band → tribe → chiefdom → state) that dominated 20th-century anthropology. Sannai-Maruyama shows that **complex, sedentary, materially rich societies** can exist without full-scale agriculture, without writing, and without metal tools.

## 4. JŌMON SPIRITUALITY AND SERPENT CONNECTIONS

### 4.1 Snake Imagery in Jōmon Art

Serpent imagery appears repeatedly in Jōmon material culture:

**Snake-decorated pottery:**
- Vessels with raised snake-like designs modeled onto the surface
- Serpentine bands coiling around pots, sometimes with identifiable snake heads
- Particularly common in Middle Jōmon ceramics from the Chubu (central Honshu) region
- Some flame-style pottery (kaen-doki) has been interpreted as incorporating serpent elements — the "flames" possibly representing undulating serpent bodies

**Snake-shaped clay objects:**
- Small clay sculptures distinctly shaped as coiled or stretched snakes
- Found at ritual deposit sites and in burials
- Tatsuo Kobayashi (Kokugakuin University, Tokyo; author of *Jōmon Reflections*, 2004) has argued that serpent imagery was central to Jōmon spirituality, possibly connected to regeneration symbolism (snakes shed their skin — rebirth/renewal)

**Connection to C01 (World Serpent Traditions):**
- If serpent imagery was significant in Jōmon culture (~5,000+ years ago), this represents one of the **oldest documented serpent-spiritual traditions** in East Asia
- Parallels to serpent worship/symbolism in:
  - Aboriginal Australian traditions (Rainbow Serpent — potentially 6,000+ years old)
  - Neolithic Near East (Göbekli Tepe serpent carvings — ~11,500 BP)
  - Mesoamerican feathered serpent traditions (later, but structurally parallel)

### 4.2 Jōmon Religion — Reconstructing the Irretrievable

Without writing, Jōmon religious beliefs must be inferred from material culture — an inherently uncertain process. However, several patterns are evident:

**Animism:**
- The ethnographic analogy with the Ainu (genetic and cultural descendants of the Jōmon in Hokkaido) suggests that Jōmon spirituality was likely **animistic** — believing that natural phenomena, animals, plants, and objects possess spiritual essence (Ainu: kamuy)
- The elaborate pottery, dogū, and ritual deposits are consistent with a worldview that treated all things as spiritually significant

**Shamanic Practices:**
- Dogū as possible **shamanic equipment**: representations of spirits seen in trance, or objects used to mediate between human and spirit worlds
- The deliberate breaking of dogū may represent a shamanic practice of "releasing" spiritual energy
- Stone "rod" objects (sekibō): possibly ritual staffs or phallic symbols used in ceremonies
- Connection to K16 (Entoptic Phenomena): geometric patterns on dogū and pottery may reflect entoptic images seen during altered states of consciousness — phosphene patterns (grids, spirals, zigzags) that are universal neural phenomena

**Ritual Tooth Extraction (Batsuishi):**
- Widespread practice in Middle–Late Jōmon: deliberate removal of specific teeth (usually upper canines and/or incisors) during adolescence
- Not dental treatment — ritual modification, possibly marking initiation or adult status
- Patterns vary by region and period — suggesting distinct cultural/ritual traditions
- Documented at over 200 Jōmon sites (Temple, 2010)
- Parallels: Aboriginal Australian initiation tooth removal, various African traditions

**Burial Practices:**
- **Flexed (crouched) burials:** the most common Jōmon burial position — body placed in fetal position, knees drawn to chest
  - Possible reasons: womb symbolism (return to earth-mother), practical (smaller grave pit), or spiritual (preventing the dead from returning)
- **Circular burial arrangements:** at many sites, burials are arranged in rings around central plazas or structures — possibly emphasizing community in death as in life
- **Jar burials (kame-kan):** infants and young children sometimes buried in large pottery vessels — protective containment?
- Stone circles as mortuary monuments — connection to ancestor veneration

### 4.3 Spiral and Meander Motifs

Many Jōmon ceramic designs feature **spirals, spiraling bands, and meander (labyrinthine) patterns:**
- These geometric motifs appear on both pottery and dogū
- Spiral motifs are among the most universal symbols in human art — found in:
  - Neolithic Europe (Newgrange, Malta)
  - Aboriginal Australia
  - Pre-Columbian Americas
  - Paleolithic cave art
- Connection to K16 (Entoptic Phenomena): spirals and meanders are classic **entoptic patterns** — geometric forms generated by the human visual system during altered states (trance, meditation, sensory deprivation, psychoactive substances)
- If Jōmon spiral motifs reflect entoptic experiences, this suggests shamanic practices were part of Jōmon spirituality — consistent with the dogū evidence

## 5. JŌMON → AINU → YAMATO TRANSITION

### 5.1 The Yayoi Migration (~900-300 BCE)

The end of the Jōmon period in most of Japan was marked by the arrival of **Yayoi** culture — migrants from the Korean Peninsula and/or mainland China who brought:
- **Wet rice agriculture** (paddy farming) — a revolutionary subsistence technology
- **Bronze and iron metallurgy** — tools and weapons far superior to Jōmon stone technology
- **Weaving** (on looms — Jōmon had fiber-working but limited loom technology)
- Different pottery style: simpler, more functional Yayoi ware
- Different physical type: taller, with different cranial and dental features than Jōmon people

**Revised Chronology:**
- Earlier dates for Yayoi beginning are now accepted: AMS radiocarbon dating of rice grains from Itazuke (Fukuoka) and other sites pushes the Yayoi start to ~900-800 BCE (Harunari et al., 2003, *Nihon Kōkogaku* / Japanese archaeology journal)
- The transition was gradual and began in **Kyushu** (closest to Korea), spreading northeast over centuries
- Reached Tohoku (northern Honshu) by ~100 CE; **never reached Hokkaido** (where Jōmon traditions continued as Ainu culture)

### 5.2 What Happened to the Jōmon People?

The Yayoi migration did not simply "replace" the Jōmon population — it was more complex:

**Genetic Evidence:**
- Modern Japanese are a **mixture** of Jōmon and continental (Yayoi/Kofun period) ancestry
- Estimated Jōmon contribution to modern mainland Japanese: **~10-20%** (varying by region)
  - Higher in Tohoku (northeast)
  - Lower in Kansai/Kinki (central — the core Yayoi area)
- **Ainu people of Hokkaido:** retain the **highest proportion** of Jōmon ancestry (~70%+)
- **Ryukyuan people (Okinawa):** retain significant Jōmon ancestry (~30%+)
- Key studies:
  - Jinam et al. (2012, *Journal of Human Genetics*): confirmed Ainu-Ryukyuan genetic cluster with high Jōmon ancestry
  - Kanzawa-Kiriyama et al. (2017, *PNAS*): sequenced ancient Jōmon DNA from Sanganji shell mound (Fukushima) — confirmed distinct from continental East Asian populations
  - Cooke et al. (2021, *Science Advances*): refined the tripartite model of Japanese ancestry (Jōmon + Yayoi + Kofun)

**Three Models:**
1. **Replacement model:** Yayoi migrants replaced Jōmon people through demographic advantage (rice farming supports much higher population densities)
2. **Transformation model:** Jōmon people adopted Yayoi technology and culture, genetically blending
3. **Dual structure model** (Hanihara Kazuro, 1991): Yayoi migrants mixed with Jōmon peoples in central/western Japan; Ainu and Ryukyuans represent less-mixed Jōmon descendants at the periphery

Current consensus favors a combination of models 1 and 3: substantial immigration from the continent, significant admixture, with peripheral populations (Ainu, Ryukyuan) retaining more Jōmon heritage.

### 5.3 The Ainu — Living Jōmon Heritage?

The **Ainu** people of Hokkaido, Sakhalin, and the Kuril Islands are the closest living connection to the Jōmon tradition:

**Ainu Culture:**
- Traditionally hunter-gatherer-fishers — salmon, marine mammals, deer, bear, plant foods
- Elaborate **bear ceremony (Iomante/Iyomante):** ritual sending-off of a bear spirit — the centermost Ainu ritual
  - A bear cub was raised in the village, then ritually sacrificed and its spirit "sent home" to the spirit world with gifts
  - Reflects a worldview in which humans and animal spirits are in reciprocal relationship
- **Kamuy** (spirits/gods): all natural things have kamuy — mountains, rivers, fire, animals, plants
  - Most important kamuy: Kim-un-kamuy (bear god), Ape-huci-kamuy (fire grandmother), Repun-kamuy (sea god)
  - Fire deity as grandmother: domestic-feminine association with hearth fire — a very old motif
- Oral literature: **yukar** (epic poems/songs), **uwepeker** (tales), **kamuy yukar** (divine songs) — rich oral literary tradition
- Fabric/textile: attush (elm bark cloth), chikarkarpe (embroidered robes with distinctive curvilinear designs)
- **Serpent/dragon traditions:** The Ainu have traditions of great serpents and dragons:
  - Kinashut-kamuy: a serpent being
  - Various stories of transforming serpents
  - Snake = both feared and respected, connected to water and underworld

**Ainu Decline:**
- Japanese (Yamato) colonization of Hokkaido accelerated in the Meiji era (post-1868)
- Hokkaido Former Natives Protection Act (1899): forced assimilation, confiscated hunting/fishing rights, suppressed language and culture
- By the 20th century, full Ainu-language speakers declined dramatically
- **2008:** Japanese Diet officially recognized Ainu as an **indigenous people** of Japan
- **2019:** Ainu Promotion Act — legal framework for preservation of Ainu culture
- **2020:** Upopoy (National Ainu Museum and Park) opened in Shiraoi, Hokkaido
- Current fluent Ainu speakers: fewer than 100 (critically endangered language)

### 5.4 The "Lost" Jōmon Knowledge

From a project perspective (F03, F07), the Jōmon → Yayoi transition represents one of the most dramatic knowledge losses in human history:

**What Was Lost:**
- **14,000+ years** of accumulated cultural knowledge — ecological, spiritual, technical, pharmacological
- Jōmon pottery traditions — among the most sophisticated in the prehistoric world — were replaced by simpler Yayoi ware
- Astronomical knowledge implied by stone circles — overwritten
- Shamanistic/spiritual traditions — partially preserved in Ainu culture, largely lost on the main islands
- Ecological knowledge of Japanese landscapes — 14 millennia of human-environment interaction knowledge

**What Survived:**
- Some Jōmon cultural elements persisted in Japanese culture:
  - Shinto has deep connections to nature worship that may reflect Jōmon-era animism (debated)
  - Japanese aesthetic sensitivity to natural forms (wabi-sabi, mono no aware) — possibly rooted in millennia of hunter-gatherer-forager relationship with the landscape
  - Rope-marking techniques in pottery
  - Elements of cuisine: use of acorns, tree nuts, marine products with elaborate processing
- Ainu culture as partial preservation of Jōmon traditions — now critically endangered
- The Ryukyuan cultural complex — elements of Jōmon heritage in Okinawan traditions (noro priestesses, utaki sacred groves, ancestral veneration)
