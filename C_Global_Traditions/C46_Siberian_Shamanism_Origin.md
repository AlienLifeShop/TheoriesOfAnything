## QUICK SUMMARY

**Siberian shamanism** is the **mother tradition** from which the very word "shaman" enters Western scholarship — derived from the **Tungusic (Evenki)** term *šaman*. This vast, diverse tradition spans the **taiga and tundra** from the Ural Mountains to the Bering Strait, encompassing dozens of ethnic groups (Evenki, Yakut, Chukchi, Buryat, Tuvan, Ket, Samoyed, and others). The Siberian shaman serves as **mediator between three cosmic worlds** — upper, middle, and lower — ascending or descending via the **World Tree** (→ C53) using the drum as a "spirit horse." The tradition is characterized by the **initiatory illness** (the "shamanic crisis"), elaborate **bone-and-metal costumes** representing the shaman's spiritual anatomy, and **ecstatic trance** induced through drumming, fasting, and sometimes psychoactive substances (→ G05, K02). Russian and Soviet ethnographers documented these traditions extensively before Soviet persecution nearly destroyed them. Today, Siberian shamanism experiences a **complex revival** — particularly in **Tuva** and **Buryatia** — blending surviving practices with reconstruction and tourism.

## 1. ETYMOLOGY AND DEFINITION

### 1.1 The Word "Shaman" [5/5 sources]

The English word "shaman" derives from the **Tungusic (Evenki)** term *šaman* (шаман), first recorded by the exiled Russian priest **Avvakum Petrov** (1672) and introduced to Western European scholarship through:

| Year | Source | Contribution |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1672 | Avvakum Petrov | First European description of Siberian shamanic practice |
| 1730 | Strahlenberg | *Nord- und östliche Theil von Europa und Asia* — introduced the term to scholarly German |
| 1951 | Mircea Eliade | *Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy* — universalized the term for comparative religion |

**Etymological debates:**
- **Tungusic origin:** Most scholars accept *šaman* derives from the Evenki verb *šā-* ("to know") → shaman = "one who knows"
- **Sanskrit theory:** Some proposed derivation from *śramaṇa* (ascetic) — via Buddhist transmission through Central Asia. Linguistically possible but unproven
- **Turkic connection:** Turkish *kam* (shaman) is a separate but parallel term

### 1.2 Eliade's Definition and Its Critics [5/5 sources]

Mircea Eliade (1951) defined shamanism as "archaic techniques of **ecstasy**" — the shaman's defining characteristic being the **controlled ecstatic trance** for the purpose of **soul flight** to other cosmic realms. This definition:
- **Distinguishes** shamanism from spirit possession (where the spirit enters the practitioner) — though in practice, Siberian shamans employ both
- **Has been criticized** for creating an overly narrow, idealized "classical" shamanism that few real practitioners perfectly embody
- **Remains influential** as the comparative baseline despite decades of nuancing

## 2. COSMOLOGY — THREE WORLDS AND THE WORLD TREE

### 2.1 The Three-World Model [5/5 sources]

Nearly all Siberian cosmologies share a tripartite structure:

| World | Inhabitants | Access |
|-------|------------|--------|
| **Upper World** | Sky deity/deities, beneficial spirits, ancestor souls of the blessed | Ascent via World Tree, pillar, mountain, rainbow |
| **Middle World** | Humans, animals, nature spirits (*ichchi* in Yakut, *segen* in Buryat) | Normal reality — but spirit-aspects hidden |
| **Lower World** | Dead (ancestors), disease spirits, Lord of the Dead (Erlik) | Descent via tree roots, holes, river currents |

### 2.2 The World Tree (*Aal Luuk Mas* — Yakut) [5/5 sources]

The cosmic/world tree is THE central axis of Siberian shamanic cosmology:
- **Roots** penetrate the lower world → access to ancestors and disease-causing spirits
- **Trunk** stands in the middle world → the shaman climbs/ascends it during trance
- **Branches** reach into the upper world → where celestial beings and the high god reside
- Physical trees (often **birch** or **larch**) serve as ritual representations
- The shaman's **drum** is made from a specific tree — this tree becomes the shaman's personal axis mundi (→ C53)

### 2.3 Cosmic Geography [4/5 sources]

Beyond the three worlds, Siberian cosmology includes:
- **Cosmic river:** Connects all worlds — the shamanic drum journey often follows a river
- **Mountain of the spirits:** An alternative axis mundi to the tree
- **The tent-like sky:** The heavens conceived as a tent (like the ger/yurt) with a smoke-hole at the top (the Pole Star)

## 3. THE SHAMANIC CALLING — INITIATORY CRISIS

### 3.1 The "Shamanic Illness" [5/5 sources]

Across Siberia, becoming a shaman is NOT a voluntary career choice — it begins with an **involuntary crisis**:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Onset** | Strange behavior: seizures, visions, withdrawal, inability to eat, wandering in wilderness |
| **2. Dismemberment vision** | The initiate "sees" spirits dismembering their body — bones picked clean, organs removed and examined, reassembled with spirit parts added |
| **3. Instruction** | Spirit teachers (often ancestor shamans) teach songs, routes, spirit names |
| **4. Recovery** | Acceptance of the calling restores health; refusal leads to madness or death |
| **5. Training** | Under an elder shaman, learning drum technique, songs, cosmological geography |

### 3.2 Hereditary vs. Spontaneous Calling [4/5 sources]

- **Hereditary:** Most common — shamanic power runs in families, typically passing through the matrilineal line (Buryat, Yakut)
- **Spontaneous:** Lightning strike, near-death experience, or unprovoked initiatory illness in persons with no shamanic ancestry
- **Both patterns** require the dismemberment/reassembly vision and elder training

### 3.3 The "Wounded Healer" Pattern [4/5 sources]

The initiatory illness creates a universal pattern: the shaman **must first be destroyed** (psychologically/visionally) before being **reassembled** with spiritual powers. This parallels:
- The **dying-and-rising god** (→ C28)
- The **hero's journey** death-and-rebirth phase (→ C54)
- Modern **clinical recovery narratives** (some psychologists compare shamanic crisis to psychotic breaks with positive resolution)

## 4. TOOLS, COSTUME, AND DRUM

### 4.1 The Drum [5/5 sources]

The drum is THE defining instrument of Siberian shamanism:

| Feature | Significance |
|---------|-------------|
| **Shape** | Oval or circular frame drum, single-headed, with handle (often antler-shaped) on reverse |
| **Membrane** | Reindeer, horse, elk, or goat hide |
| **Decoration** | Painted or drawn cosmological maps (three worlds, world tree, spirit figures) |
| **Symbolism** | The drum IS the shaman's "horse" or "reindeer" — ridden on spirit journeys |
| **Sound** | Monotonous rhythmic beating (4–7 Hz) → induces **photic driving** and trance states (→ K15) |
| **Sacredness** | Each drum is unique to its shaman; breaking the drum can kill the shaman spiritually |

**Acoustic research** (Harner 1990; Becker 2004) demonstrates that sustained drumming at 4–4.5 Hz **induces theta brainwave patterns** — the same frequency range associated with deep meditation, hypnagogic states, and REM sleep (→ K05, K08).

### 4.2 The Costume [4/5 sources]

The shamanic costume is a **map of the spiritual body**:
- **Metal discs/pendants:** Represent bones — the costume IS the shaman's "skeleton" reassembled after initiatory dismemberment
- **Mirrors (toli):** Deflect hostile spirits, see distant events
- **Fringes/tassels:** Represent wings or feathers for spirit flight
- **Animal parts:** Feathers (eagle, owl), fur (bear, wolf) — animal spirit helpers attached
- **Iron ornaments:** Iron has **anti-spirit** properties in Siberian belief — protects the shaman during dangerous journeys

### 4.3 The Beater / Drumstick [3/5 sources]

The drum beater is equally significant:
- Made from a specific wood (birch, willow)
- Covered in fur (often from the shaman's spirit animal)
- Used to "steer" the drum-horse during soul flight
- Also used as a divination tool — balanced on the drum, its movements interpreted

## 5. THE SÉANCE (KAMLANIE) — JOURNEY AND HEALING

### 5.1 Structure of a Typical Séance [5/5 sources]

| Stage | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **1. Preparation** | Darkness (or twilight); participants seated; fire low; offerings prepared (fat, milk, vodka) |
| **2. Invocation of spirits** | Shaman calls spirit helpers by name, imitates animal sounds (birds, wolves, bears) |
| **3. Heating the drum** | Drum held over fire to tighten membrane — adjusts pitch. Drumming begins slowly |
| **4. Trance entry** | Drumming intensifies; shaman begins dancing, jumping, contorting; eyes close or roll |
| **5. Spirit journey** | Shaman's soul leaves body — travels to upper or lower world for diagnosis/healing/negotiation |
| **6. Encounter** | Shaman bargains with disease spirits, retrieves lost souls, consults ancestors |
| **7. Return** | Drumming slows; shaman "lands"; reports what was seen and done |
| **8. Follow-up** | Offerings made; patient given instructions (taboos, amulets, dietary changes) |

### 5.2 Soul Retrieval [4/5 sources]

The most characteristic healing method in Siberian shamanism is **soul retrieval**:
- Illness is understood as **soul loss** — part of the patient's soul has been stolen by spirits or has wandered away
- The shaman **journeys to find and return** the lost soul fragment
- This concept has direct parallels in Amazonian shamanism (→ C47), Australian Aboriginal practice (→ C30), and modern therapeutic approaches (→ K15)

### 5.3 Weather Magic and Divination [3/5 sources]

Beyond healing, Siberian shamans perform:
- **Weather control:** Calling rain/snow through spirit negotiation, redirecting storms
- **Hunting magic:** Locating game herds and negotiating with animal master-spirits
- **Scapulimancy:** Reading cracks in burned animal shoulder blades for divination (shared across East/Central Asia → C45, C32)

## 6. REGIONAL TRADITIONS

### 6.1 Major Siberian Shamanic Cultures [5/5 sources]

| People | Region | Distinctive Features |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| **Evenki** (Tungus) | Central/Eastern Siberia | Source of the word "shaman"; reindeer-riding; elaborate tent-pole cosmos |
| **Yakut** (Sakha) | Republic of Sakha | World Tree (Aal Luuk Mas); extensive oral epic tradition (*olonkho*); blacksmith shamans |
| **Buryat** | Baikal region | "White" (sky) and "black" (underworld) shamans; strong ancestor focus; significant post-Soviet revival |
| **Tuvan** | Tuva Republic | Famous for **throat singing** (khoomei); shamanic organizations revived after 1990; tourism |
| **Chukchi** | Far northeast | Not a "shaman" model but "transformed person" (**ene'nilit**); gender transformation traditions; arctic extreme |
| **Ket** | Yenisei River | Isolated language; bear ceremonialism; one of Siberia's most archaic traditions |
| **Ainu** | Sakhalin/Hokkaido | Bear sacrifice festival (*iyomante*); spirit intermediary (*ekashi*); connection to Japanese → A15 |

### 6.2 Tuvan Throat Singing and Shamanism [4/5 sources]

Tuva preserves a unique connection between **throat singing (khoomei)** and shamanic practice:
- Khoomei produces **multiple simultaneous frequencies** from a single voice
- Traditional belief: throat singing communicates with nature spirits through the **overtone series**
- The sound is understood as containing "hidden voices" or "spirit voices" within the overtones
- Connection to broader claims about sound as a consciousness-altering technology (→ J06, J07)

## 7. COUNTER-ARGUMENTS AND SCHOLARLY DEBATE

| Claim | Supporting Evidence | Counter-Evidence | Assessment |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| Siberian shamanism is the "original" form of all religion | Antiquity of practice; the word itself comes from here; circumpolar distribution | Shamanism-like practices arise independently worldwide; "original religion" is unfalsifiable | **Tier 2** — Siberia is the etymological source but not necessarily the historical origin |
| Shamanic trance is a genuine altered state | EEG studies show theta shift; consistent cross-cultural phenomenology | Skeptics argue "role-playing" or cultural performance; placebo effects | **Tier 1–2** — neurological correlates confirmed; "genuine" is definitionally complex |
| Soviet persecution destroyed authentic shamanism | Last traditional shamans killed/imprisoned; oral lineages broken | Some traditions survived in hiding; elderly practitioners emerged post-1990 | **Tier 1** — severe damage documented, but not total elimination |
| Modern Siberian shamanism is authentic continuation | Post-1990 revival draws on ethnographic records and surviving elders | Tourism, New Age imports, reinvention inevitable after 70-year suppression gap | **Tier 2** — mixed authentic/reconstructed |
| Shamanic crisis = psychotic break | Similar symptoms (hallucinations, dissociation, bizarre behavior) | Resolution is functional (shaman becomes healer), not chronic; cultural context channels the experience | **Tier 2** — overlap in presentation, divergent in outcome |
