## QUICK SUMMARY

**Tengrism** is one of the world's oldest continually practiced sky-god religions, centered on **Möngke Tengri** ("Eternal Blue Sky") as the supreme cosmic deity. Originating among the **Turkic-Mongol peoples** of the Central Asian steppe, Tengrism provided the spiritual foundation for empires spanning from the **Xiongnu** (3rd century BCE) through **Genghis Khan's Mongol Empire** (13th century CE). Unlike the Abrahamic traditions, Tengrism posits no scriptures, no prophets, and no formal theology — it is preserved through **shamanic practice** (bö/böö/kam), oral tradition, and ritual engagement with **landscape** (sacred mountains, ovoo cairns, rivers). The Mongolian-Turkic shaman served as **healer, diviner, psychopomp**, and mediator between the three cosmic realms (→ K15, N06). Despite centuries of Buddhist (→ C39), Islamic (→ C61), and Soviet suppression, Tengrism survives in Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Buryatia, and Tuva — and is experiencing a significant **post-Soviet revival** as part of national identity movements.

## 1. TENGRISM — THE ETERNAL BLUE SKY

### 1.1 Core Cosmology [5/5 sources]

Tengrism organizes reality into three interconnected realms:

| Realm | Name (Mongolian) | Description |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Upper World** | Deed Tengri | Realm of 99 tengri (celestial spirits), dominated by Möngke Tengri (Eternal Blue Sky) |
| **Middle World** | Delkhii | Earth — inhabited by humans, nature spirits (*gazryn ezed*), and animal spirits |
| **Lower World** | Erleg Khan's realm | Realm of the dead, ruled by Erleg Khan (lord of the underworld) |

**The World Tree / World Mountain** connects these three realms — the axis mundi in Tengrism is typically a **cosmic pillar** or **sacred mountain** (Burkhan Khaldun in Mongolia, regarded as Genghis Khan's birthplace mountain → C53, C57).

### 1.2 Key Theological Concepts [4/5 sources]

- **Tengri** is NOT a personal god — Tengri is the **sky itself** as a conscious cosmic force. "Blue" (kök) carries spiritual connotation in Turkic languages
- **Yer-Sub** (Earth-Water): The feminine counterpart to Sky-Tengri, representing the living earth
- **Kut/Sülde:** A person's life force or destiny-spirit, bestowed by Tengri — particularly important for rulers (→ C17)
- **Ongon:** Ancestral spirit representations — felt or wooden figures kept in the ger (yurt) and consulted through shamanic intermediaries
- **Tngri (plural):** Various celestial spirits — some traditions list 99 upper tengri and 77 lower tengri

## 2. THE SHAMAN (BÖ/KAM) IN MONGOL-TURKIC SOCIETY

### 2.1 Shamanic Roles [5/5 sources]

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Weather control** | Calling rain or clearing storms through jade stones (*yada tash*) and invocations |
| **Healing** | Diagnosing spirit-caused illness, soul retrieval, herbal medicine |
| **Divination** | Scapulimancy (shoulder-blade reading), dream interpretation, bone-casting |
| **Psychopomp** | Guiding souls of the dead to the underworld; protecting living from vengeful spirits |
| **Political advisor** | Court shamans advising khans on timing, strategy, and spiritual legitimacy |

### 2.2 Shamanic Tools and Regalia [4/5 sources]

- **Drum (khese/dungur):** Oval frame drum representing the shaman's "horse" for spirit travel — the single most important shamanic instrument across all Central/North Asian traditions (→ C46)
- **Mirror (toli):** Bronze or steel mirror worn on the chest — deflects hostile spirits
- **Headdress (maigalag):** Often with antlers, feathers, or metal ornaments representing spirit helpers
- **Whip (tashuur):** Used to drive away negative spirits
- **Costume:** Fabric strips, metal pendants, fur — each element represents a specific spirit ally

### 2.3 The Shamanic Séance [4/5 sources]

A full Tengrist shamanic ceremony involves:
1. **Preparation:** Fasting, purification with juniper smoke (*artsyn arshaan*)
2. **Invocation:** Drumming, chanting, calling spirit helpers by name
3. **Trance entry:** Increased drumming speed → ecstatic state (→ K15)
4. **Spirit journey:** Shaman's soul travels to upper/lower world
5. **Return:** Communication of obtained information
6. **Offerings:** Airag (fermented mare's milk), fat, incense to ancestral spirits

## 3. GENGHIS KHAN'S SPIRITUAL FRAMEWORK

### 3.1 Tengri's Mandate [5/5 sources]

Genghis Khan (c. 1162–1227) understood his world-conquering mission as a direct mandate from **Möngke Tengri**. The **Secret History of the Mongols** (c. 1228) records:

> *"By the power of Eternal Heaven (*Möngke Tengri*), I have conquered for you a huge empire."*

This "Mandate of Heaven" concept parallels the Chinese *Tianming* (→ C32) but is distinct — Tengri did not specify moral governance requirements. Genghis Khan interpreted all military success as divine confirmation.

### 3.2 Religious Tolerance [4/5 sources]

Despite his personal Tengrist identity, Genghis Khan enacted remarkable **religious tolerance**:
- The **Yasa** (law code) exempted religious leaders of ALL faiths from taxation
- Franciscan friar William of Rubruck (1253) reported Buddhist, Muslim, Christian, and shamanic practitioners at the Mongol court simultaneously
- This tolerance was **strategic** (preventing rebellion) and **theological** (Tengri was understood as supreme over all other gods, making their worship acceptable)

### 3.3 Court Shamans [4/5 sources]

The most famous Mongol shaman was **Teb Tengri** (Kökechu), who:
- Climbed a mountain naked and claimed Tengri spoke through him
- Validated Temüjin's selection as Genghis Khan
- Became so powerful he threatened the throne — eventually executed by wrestling "accident"
- His story illustrates the **political power of shamans** and the tension between spiritual and temporal authority (→ N06)

## 4. RITUAL PRACTICE AND SACRED LANDSCAPE

### 4.1 Ovoo (Cairn) Worship [5/5 sources]

**Ovoo** (stone cairns found across Mongolia) are the most visible feature of Tengrist sacred landscape:
- Located on mountain passes, hilltops, crossroads
- Travelers circle three times clockwise, adding a stone and making offerings (vodka, milk, blue silk, coins)
- Each ovoo is home to a **gazryn ezed** (local nature spirit)
- Largest ovoos have **annual festivals** with horse racing, wrestling, and offerings

### 4.2 The Ger as Sacred Space [4/5 sources]

The Mongolian ger (yurt) encodes cosmological principles:
- **Circular plan:** Represents the universe
- **Toono (smoke-hole):** The axis mundi connecting sky and earth — sunlight patterns on the floor serve as a sun-dial
- **Door always faces south:** Organizational axis tied to cardinal directions
- **Sacred north (khoimor):** Honored guest/altar position, opposite the door
- **Hearth (gal goloomto):** Sacred center — never step over it, never add trash to it

### 4.3 Sacred Mountains [4/5 sources]

| Mountain | Location | Significance |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Burkhan Khaldun** | Khentii, Mongolia | Genghis Khan's birth/burial mountain, UNESCO site, women traditionally forbidden |
| **Bogd Khan Uul** | Ulaanbaatar | Possibly world's oldest legally protected area (1778) |
| **Otgontenger** | Zavkhan, Mongolia | Sacred to Ochirvaani (Vajrapani) — Buddhist-Tengrist fusion |

## 5. SURVIVAL, SUPPRESSION, AND REVIVAL

### 5.1 Suppression Timeline [4/5 sources]

| Period | Agent | Effect |
|--------|-------|--------|
| 16th–17th century | Tibetan Buddhism | Buddhist missionaries systematically replaced shamans; Third Dalai Lama converted Altan Khan (1578) |
| 1920s–1990 | Soviet Union | Shamans persecuted as "feudal remnants"; monasteries destroyed (over 700 in Mongolia); practitioners imprisoned or executed |
| Maoist China | CCP | Inner Mongolian shamanic practice severely restricted during Cultural Revolution |
| Post-1990 | Revival | Democratic Mongolia (1990) — constitutional freedom of religion → Tengrist and shamanic revival |

### 5.2 Post-Soviet Revival [4/5 sources]

Since 1990, Tengrism has experienced remarkable revival:
- **Mongolia:** National identity marker — Genghis Khan as culture hero; shamans now practice openly; international shamanism conferences held in Ulaanbaatar
- **Kyrgyzstan:** Tengrism officially recognized (2012); Tengrist party operates politically
- **Kazakhstan:** Tengri symbolism in state ceremonies; traditional healers (*baqsy*) resume practice
- **Buryatia (Russia):** Shamanic organizations registered; annual **Tailagan** ceremonies attract thousands
- **Turkey:** "neo-Tengrism" movement among nationalist and spiritual-alternative communities — controversial claims about pre-Islamic Turkish identity

## 6. COUNTER-ARGUMENTS AND SCHOLARLY DEBATE

| Claim | Supporting Evidence | Counter-Evidence | Assessment |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| Tengrism is a unified, coherent religion | Similar sky-god structure across Turkic-Mongol peoples | No scriptures, no formal doctrine, massive regional variation | **Tier 2** — common framework, not a unified "ism" |
| Tengrism predates all Abrahamic religions | Sky-god worship in steppe from at least Bronze Age | Written evidence only from 6th century CE Turkic inscriptions; earlier practice inferred | **Tier 2** — antiquity plausible but not datable with precision |
| Genghis Khan was "tolerant" by modern standards | Exempted clergy, allowed all faiths | Tolerance was political strategy; mass killing in warfare systematic | **Mixed** — religious tolerance coexisted with military brutality |
| Post-Soviet Tengrism is "authentic" restoration | Draws on ethnographic records and surviving oral traditions | Modern revival inevitably reconstructed, influenced by New Age, nationalism | **Tier 2** — genuine revival but also reinvention |
