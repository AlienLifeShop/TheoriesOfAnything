## QUICK SUMMARY

Korean shamanism (**Muism** or **Musok**, 무속) is one of the oldest continuous spiritual traditions in East Asia, predating the introduction of Buddhism (4th century CE) and Confucianism to the Korean peninsula. Centered on **mudang** (무당) — predominantly female ritual specialists who mediate between the human and spirit worlds through ecstatic possession, dance, song, and elaborate multi-day ceremonies called **gut** (굿) — Muism represents a living example of the ancient worldwide shamanistic pattern. Its founding myth of **Dangun**, the divine being born from the union of a heavenly prince and a bear-woman, encodes themes of celestial descent, animal transformation, and sacred kingship that echo across global traditions.

## 1. WHAT IS MUISM?

### 1.1 Definition and Scope [4/5 sources]

**Muism** (무교, Mugyo, literally "the religion of the mu") is Korea's indigenous spiritual tradition. The term **mu** (무, 巫) corresponds to the Chinese **wu** (巫, shaman/spirit medium), denoting a person who communicates with spirits. Unlike organized religions with codified scriptures and institutional hierarchies, Muism operates through:

- Individual practitioners (**mudang**) who receive direct spiritual calling
- Ritual performances (**gut**) for specific purposes (healing, divination, guiding the dead, community protection)
- A vast oral tradition of mythological songs (**muga**, 무가) transmitted through apprenticeship
- Household and village-level worship at shrines, sacred trees, and stone guardians (**jangseung**)

Lee (2018) estimates that Muism has been practiced on the Korean peninsula for at least 5,000 years, making it contemporaneous with the earliest Sumerian religious practices documented in this project.

### 1.2 Terminology [3/5 sources]

| **Baksu** | 박수 | Male shaman (less common) |
| **Gut / Kut** | 굿 | Shamanistic ritual ceremony |
| **Mugam** | 무감 | Trance state during possession |
| **Sin-nae-rim** | 신내림 | "Spirit descent" — initiatory calling |

## 2. THE DANGUN MYTH — DIVINE FOUNDATION

### 2.1 The Origin Narrative [4/5 sources]

The founding myth of the Korean nation, recorded in the **Samguk Yusa** (三國遺事, *Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms*, compiled 1281 CE by the monk Iryeon), describes the creation of Korea through divine descent:

1. **Hwanin** (환인) — the Lord of Heaven — has a son, **Hwanung** (환웅), who desires to descend and govern the human world
2. Hwanin looks down upon the **three great mountains** and selects **Mount Taebaek** (태백산) as the place of descent
3. Hwanung descends with **3,000 followers** and establishes the **City of God** (신시, Sinsi) beneath a sacred tree
4. He brings three heavenly seals and governs wind, rain, and clouds through subordinate spirits
5. A **bear** and a **tiger** pray to Hwanung to become human
6. Hwanung instructs them to eat only mugwort and garlic in a cave for 100 days, away from sunlight
7. The tiger gives up, but the bear perseveres and transforms into a **woman** (웅녀, Ungnyeo)
8. Ungnyeo prays for a child; Hwanung takes human form and marries her
9. Their son is **Dangun Wanggeom** (단군왕검), who founds the kingdom of **Gojoseon** in 2333 BCE

### 2.2 Pattern Analysis [3/5 sources]

This myth encodes several patterns central to this project:

| Element | Korean Myth | Global Parallel |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Divine descent** to earth | Hwanung descends from heaven | Anunnaki descent (A01), Watchers (A04), Viracocha (C04) |
| **Sacred mountain** as axis mundi | Mount Taebaek | Mount Meru (Hindu), Mount Hermon (Enoch), Olympus |
| **Animal-to-human transformation** | Bear becomes woman | Shape-shifting beings across traditions (B01) |
| **Divine-human hybridization** | Hwanung + Ungnyeo = Dangun | Nephilim (B10), divine kings worldwide (C17) |
| **3,000 followers** | Hwanung's entourage | Comparable to Enoch's 200 Watchers |
| **Civilization gifts** | Agriculture, law, medicine | Apkallu sages (A07), Prometheus (C18) |
| **Sacred tree** | Tree at Sinsi | World Tree / Yggdrasil / Tree of Knowledge |
| **Test/trial** | 100 days in cave | Initiatory ordeals globally |

The Dangun myth thus participates in the **divine civilizer** pattern: a heavenly being descends, brings knowledge and governance, and establishes sacred kingship through union with the terrestrial world.

## 3. THE MUDANG — KOREAN SHAMAN PRACTITIONERS

### 3.1 Initiatory Calling — Sinbyeong [4/5 sources]

The mudang does not choose to become a shaman — she is **chosen by spirits**. The calling manifests as **sinbyeong** (신병, "spirit sickness"), a period of physical and psychological crisis that may include:

- Severe physical illness with no medical explanation
- Vivid dreams and visions of spirits, ancestors, or deities
- Inability to eat, sleep, or function normally
- Hearing voices or seeing beings invisible to others
- Compulsive behavior (singing, dancing, speaking in altered voices)
- Family misfortune and social disruption

Rhi (1993) conducted phenomenological analysis of sinbyeong and found it structurally identical to shamanic initiatory crises documented across Siberia, the Americas, and Australia — the pattern Mircea Eliade termed the "shamanic election." The individual experiences a psychospiritual death and rebirth, after which they possess the ability to traverse the boundary between human and spirit worlds.

The initiation is completed through the **naerim gut** (내림굿, "descent ceremony"), in which an experienced mudang guides the initiate through ritual possession, confirming which spirits have claimed the new shaman. From this point, the mudang serves these spirits for life.

### 3.2 Types of Mudang [3/5 sources]

| Type | Region | Characteristics |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| **Gangsinmu** (강신무) | Central/Northern Korea | Ecstatic possession; spirit speaks through mudang; dramatic trance states |
| **Seseummu** (세습무) | Southern Korea | Hereditary; learned through apprenticeship; less ecstatic, more ritualistic |
| **Simbangmu** | Jeju Island | Mixed tradition; distinctive island practices |

The northern/central gangsinmu tradition is the "classic" form studied most extensively by scholars and represents the most direct parallel to Siberian and Central Asian shamanism.

### 3.3 Social Position [3/5 sources]

Historically, mudang occupied a paradoxical social position:
- Regarded as **essential** for community wellbeing (healing, death rites, divination)
- Yet classified as belonging to the **cheonmin** (천민, "base people") caste during the Joseon dynasty
- Predominantly **female** in a patriarchal Confucian society — their spiritual authority was simultaneously acknowledged and marginalized
- Often come from families with hereditary shamanistic lineages, despite the "calling" model

Kister (2006) argues that the mudang's marginal social status — powerful yet despised — mirrors the position of shamans, witches, and female mediums in nearly every culture that has attempted to suppress indigenous spiritual practices.

## 4. GUT RITUAL — THE CEREMONIAL HEART

### 4.1 Structure of the Gut [4/5 sources]

A **gut** is a multi-part ritual performance lasting from several hours to multiple days. A major gut may consist of 12 or more **geori** (거리, "segments"), each dedicated to a specific deity or spirit. The mudang performs through:

- **Dance** — Elaborate costumed movement, often with weapons (knives, tridents), fans, flags
- **Song** — Muga (shamanistic narratives) telling the origin stories of deities
- **Possession** — The spirit enters the mudang, who speaks/acts as the deity
- **Oracle** — The spirit delivers messages, diagnoses illness, reveals hidden causes
- **Sacrifice** — Food offerings, often a pig's head; in ancient times, larger animal sacrifice
- **Comedy** — Deliberately humorous segments to entertain both spirits and audience

### 4.2 Types of Gut [3/5 sources]

| Gut Type | Purpose | Duration |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Jinogi gut** | Healing illness | Hours to 1 day |
| **Ssitkim gut** | Guiding dead to afterlife (psychopomp) | 1–3 days |
| **Byeolshin gut** | Village-level community protection | 3–7 days |
| **Dodang gut** | Annual village celebration | Full day |
| **Naerim gut** | Initiation of new mudang | Multi-day |
| **Jaesu gut** | Prosperity and good fortune | Half-day to full day |

The **ssitkim gut** (씻김굿, literally "washing/cleansing gut") — the death rite — is particularly significant. The mudang contacts the spirit of the deceased, allows the dead person to speak through her body (often in the deceased's voice, recounting details known only to family members), resolves unfinished emotional business, and guides the spirit to the afterworld. This is a direct parallel to the **psychopomp** function found in:

- Greek Hermes/Charon guiding souls across the Styx
- Egyptian Anubis conducting the dead through the Duat
- The Orphic descent (see [C25](../C_Global_Traditions/C25_Orpheus_Descent_Underworld_Archetype.md))
- Aboriginal Australian "singing the dead" (see [C30](../C_Global_Traditions/C30_Australian_Aboriginal_Dreamtime.md))

### 4.3 The Mudang's Tools [2/5 sources]

| Tool | Korean | Function |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Sinkal** | 신칼 | Spirit sword — used for cutting away evil, danced on blade edges |
| **Myeongdu** | 명두 | Bronze mirror — spirit communication, divination |
| **Bangul** | 방울 | Bells — calling/dismissing spirits |
| **Busae** | 부채 | Fan — directing spiritual energy |
| **Mubok** | 무복 | Ritual costumes (changed for each spirit) |
| **Janggu** | 장구 | Double-headed drum — rhythm for trance induction |

## 5. COSMOLOGY AND SPIRIT WORLD

### 5.1 The Three Realms [3/5 sources]

Korean shamanistic cosmology divides the universe into three interconnected realms:

1. **Cheongsang** (천상, Celestial realm) — domain of heavenly deities (Cheonsin, Hwanin)
2. **Jisang** (지상, Terrestrial realm) — the human world
3. **Jiha** (지하, Underground/underworld) — realm of the dead, also associated with water spirits

This tripartite structure mirrors:
- The Sumerian division of An (heaven), Ki (earth), Kur (underworld)
- The Norse Asgard, Midgard, Hel
- The Hindu triloka (svarga, bhumi, patala)
- The Daoist Three Realms (see [C32](../C_Global_Traditions/C32_Daoism_Chinese_Alchemy.md))

### 5.2 Major Spirit Categories [3/5 sources]

| Category | Examples | Function |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Cheonsin** (천신) | Hwanin, Hwanung | Heavenly deities; cosmic order |
| **Sansin** (산신) | Mountain spirits | Guardians of mountains; depicted as old men with tigers |
| **Yongwang** (용왕) | Dragon King | Lord of waters; rain, fishing, sea safety |
| **Josang** (조상) | Ancestor spirits | Family guidance, protection, or punishment |
| **Jishin** (지신) | Earth spirits | Land fertility, household prosperity |
| **Dokgaebi** (도깨비) | Trickster spirits | Mischief, hidden treasure, tests |
| **Gwishin** (귀신) | Restless ghosts | Unresolved dead requiring ritual appeasement |

### 5.3 The Seonangdang — Sacred Sites [2/5 sources]

Throughout Korea, stone cairns, sacred trees, and small shrines called **seonangdang** (서낭당) mark village boundaries and sacred spots. These sites serve as communication points with the spirit world and are maintained with offerings. Wooden guardian figures (**jangseung**, 장승) stand at village entrances, carved with fierce faces to ward off evil spirits and disease. This practice of marking sacred boundaries with guardian figures parallels:

- Greek **hermai** (stone pillars of Hermes at crossroads)
- Japanese **torii** gates marking sacred Shinto spaces
- Celtic sacred groves and boundary stones

## 6. SUPPRESSION AND SURVIVAL

### 6.1 Confucian Persecution [4/5 sources]

The **Joseon dynasty** (1392–1897) adopted Neo-Confucianism as state ideology and systematically persecuted Muism:

- Mudang were classified as **cheonmin** (lowest social class), alongside butchers and slaves
- Shamanistic rituals were banned or restricted in urban areas
- Scholars attacked Muism as "superstition" (미신, misin) harmful to proper social order
- Royal edicts periodically expelled mudang from the capital (Seoul)

Despite 500 years of official suppression, Muism survived because:
- Confucian households still secretly called mudang for healing and death rites
- Women, who ran households, maintained shamanistic practices despite Confucian patriarchal disapproval
- Village-level gut rituals continued in rural areas beyond effective state control
- The Japanese colonial period (1910–1945) ironically documented and preserved Muist practices through ethnographic study

### 6.2 Modern Status [3/5 sources]

- South Korea has designated numerous gut traditions as **Important Intangible Cultural Heritage** (국가무형문화재)
- The **Gangneung Danoje** festival (containing shamanistic elements) received UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage designation in 2005
- An estimated 300,000+ Koreans identify as Muist practitioners
- Mudang continue to practice in Seoul and major cities, often blending traditional and modern elements
- Recent academic and popular interest has increased, especially after the political scandal involving President Park Geun-hye and her confidante Choi Soon-sil (2016), which revealed the continuing influence of shamanistic advisors at the highest levels of Korean power

## 7. CROSS-CULTURAL PARALLELS

### 7.1 Muism and Siberian Shamanism [3/5 sources]

Korean shamanism shares deep structural features with Siberian/Central Asian shamanism:

| Feature | Korean Muism | Siberian Shamanism |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Spirit illness initiation | Sinbyeong | Shamanic sickness / dismemberment visions |
| Ecstatic possession | Gangsinmu trance | Drumming-induced trance |
| Costume changes for spirits | Multiple robes per gut | Symbolic costume with animal spirits |
| Psychopomp function | Ssitkim gut | Soul retrieval / death guiding |
| Sacred drum | Janggu | Frame drum (tungur) |
| World tree concept | Seonangdang tree | World Tree / shamanic pole |
| Predominantly female variant | Mudang majority female | Female shamans (udagan) in some traditions |

These parallels support the hypothesis that Korean shamanism represents the eastern terminus of a **pan-Eurasian shamanistic belt** extending from Scandinavia through Siberia to Korea and Japan.

### 7.2 Muism and Japanese Shinto/Miko [2/5 sources]

The Japanese **miko** (巫女, shrine maiden) tradition — female ritual specialists at Shinto shrines who historically performed possession rituals and divination — may share common origins with the Korean mudang. Both traditions:
- Feature predominantly female practitioners
- Involve spirit possession and oracular speech
- Were historically suppressed by Buddhist/Confucian authorities
- Maintain continuity with pre-literate indigenous spirituality

## 8. COUNTER-ARGUMENTS AND SCHOLARLY DEBATE

### 8.1 Against Antiquity Claims [3/5 sources]

- The Dangun myth was first recorded in 1281 CE — claims of 5,000-year antiquity are based on the mythological date (2333 BCE), not archaeological evidence
- Written documentation of Muism postdates Confucian and Buddhist arrivals; pre-literate practices are reconstructed, not directly attested
- Some elements may be later Buddhist or Chinese imports rather than indigenous Korean developments

### 8.2 Against Cross-Cultural Connection [2/5 sources]

- Structural parallels with Siberian shamanism may reflect shared human neurology (trance states, altered consciousness) rather than historical diffusion
- Every culture has healing rituals, death rites, and spirit mediums — similarity does not prove contact
- Post-hoc pattern matching risks projecting connections that the practitioners themselves would not recognize

### 8.3 Against Spiritual Claims [3/5 sources]

- Mudang "knowledge" of the deceased may result from cold-reading techniques, prior community knowledge, and audience cooperation
- Sinbyeong symptoms are consistent with various psychiatric conditions (dissociative disorders, psychotic episodes)
- Clinical distinction between genuine calling and mental illness is unresolved
