## QUICK SUMMARY

**Slavic mythology** represents the **largest European mythological system** that has lacked a dedicated document in this knowledge base until now — covering over **300 million** speakers of Slavic languages across Eastern Europe. Unlike Norse or Greek traditions, Slavic paganism left **no pre-Christian literary texts**: our knowledge comes from hostile Christian chronicles, comparative linguistics, folklore survivals, and archaeology. The central mythological opposition — **Perun** (sky/thunder god) vs. **Veles** (chthonic serpent-cattle god) — preserves the **Proto-Indo-European storm-god myth** (→ C56) in arguably its most structurally pure form: Perun in the **treetop/sky**, Veles at the **roots/underworld**, locked in eternal seasonal combat. The three-realm cosmology — **Prav** (divine), **Yav** (living), **Nav** (dead) — organized around a **world tree** (→ C53) mirrors broader IE patterns while maintaining distinctive Slavic characteristics. The phenomenon of **dvoeverie** ("dual faith") after Christianization (988 CE in Kievan Rus') ensured that pagan beliefs, rituals, and deity-figures survived within a Christian framework for centuries.

## 1. VERIFIED CLAIMS (Tier 1 — Peer-Reviewed / Archaeological Record)

### 1.1 The Christianization of the Slavs and Destruction of Pagan Records [5/5 sources]

The fundamental problem of Slavic mythology studies:
- **No pre-Christian Slavic literary text** survives — unlike Norse (*Eddas*), Greek (*Iliad/Odyssey*), or Vedic (*Rig Veda*)
- Christianity penetrated Slavic lands between the **9th–12th centuries**: Bulgaria (864), Kievan Rus' (988), Poland (966)
- Pagan temples, idols, and sacred groves were **systematically destroyed**
- Primary sources are **hostile Christian accounts**: the Russian Primary Chronicle (*Povest' Vremennykh Let*, ~1113 CE), Helmold's *Chronica Slavorum* (1167), Procopius (*Wars* 6th c.)
- Archaeological evidence: **Zbruch idol** (9th c., four-faced stone pillar), Arkona temple on Rügen (Svantevit shrine, destroyed 1168), Rethra temple site

### 1.2 Vladimir's Pantheon (980 CE) [5/5 sources]

Prince **Vladimir I of Kiev**, before his conversion to Christianity (988), established a **state pantheon** in 980 CE:

> "Vladimir placed idols on the hill outside the castle: **Perun** of wood with a silver head and golden mustache, and **Khors**, **Dazhbog**, **Stribog**, **Simargl**, and **Mokosh**." — *Primary Chronicle*

| Deity | Domain | IE Parallel |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Perun** | Thunder, war, oaths, oak | *Perkwunos (PIE), Thor, Jupiter |
| **Khors** | Sun (solar disk) | Iranian *xwar* (sun) |
| **Dazhbog** | Sun, prosperity, "giving god" | Vedic solar deities |
| **Stribog** | Wind, air, atmospheric forces | (disputed) |
| **Simargl** | Winged dog/guardian | Iranian Simurgh |
| **Mokosh** | Earth, fertility, weaving, fate | IE earth-mother / Moirai |

- **Notable absence**: Veles is NOT in Vladimir's official pantheon — he was worshipped **separately**, lower in the city (by the market/river)
- This spatial separation (Perun on the hill, Veles below) **mirrors the cosmic opposition** between sky-god and chthonic deity

### 1.3 Archaeological Evidence [4/5 sources]

- **Zbruch idol** (Podolia, Ukraine, 9th c.): four-sided limestone pillar with three tiers of figures — interpreted as representing the three cosmic realms (Prav/Yav/Nav)
- **Arkona** (Rügen island): temple of **Svantevit** (four-headed god) described by Saxo Grammaticus — destroyed by Danes in 1168; partial archaeological confirmation
- **Rethra** (Mecklenburg): temple of Radegast/Svarozhich — known from chronicles but exact location debated
- **Peryn** (near Novgorod): site of a Perun shrine — post-hole pattern shows a **flower-shaped** ground plan with ritual fire pits

## 2. CREDIBLE CLAIMS (Tier 2 — Academic / Debated but Supported)

### 2.1 Perun vs. Veles — The Core Myth [5/5 sources]

The **Ivanov-Toporov reconstruction** (1974) is the most influential model of Slavic mythology:
- **Perun** (from PIE *\*per-* "to strike") = the thunder god, dwelling in the **sky/treetop** (the oak)
- **Veles** (from PIE *\*wel-* "the dead" or "cattle") = the chthonic god of the **underworld/tree roots**, associated with cattle, water, wealth, and the dead
- Their opposition = the **PIE storm-god vs. serpent** pattern (→ C56 §2.2):
  - Veles **steals** something from Perun (cattle, wife, child, or water)
  - Perun **pursues** Veles with thunderbolts
  - Veles **hides** behind trees, stones, animals, people (places struck by lightning)
  - Perun **strikes** Veles; the stolen goods (or rain) are **released**
  - Veles **returns to the underworld** — but the cycle **repeats**
- This is not a one-time event but the **engine of the seasonal/storm cycle**
- Comparative parallel: this is the **closest surviving reflex** of the PIE *\*Perkwunos vs. \*Welnos* opposition (→ C56)

### 2.2 Mokosh — The Earth Mother [4/5 sources]

- **Mokosh** (Мокошь): the **only female deity** in Vladimir's pantheon
- Associated with **earth, moisture, weaving, fate, sheep-shearing**
- Name possibly from *mok-* "wet" — she is the moist earth
- **Survives** in Christianity as **Paraskeva Pyatnitsa** ("St. Friday") — patron of weaving and women
- Parallels: Norse Frigg/Freyja, Baltic Laima, Greek Moirai (fate-spinners)
- Connection to the broader IE *\*Dhéǵhōm* ("Earth") as goddess — Slavic *Mati Syra Zemlya* ("Moist Mother Earth")

### 2.3 Svarog and the Smith-God Tradition [3/5 sources]

- **Svarog** = sky-smith god, father of Dazhbog (the sun)
- Name from PIE *\*swor-* "sky/heaven" (cf. Sanskrit *svar*, "sun/sky")
- Svarog as divine **blacksmith** — forged the sun and gave fire and plowshares to humanity
- His son **Svarozhich** ("son of Svarog") = fire itself
- Parallel to Greek Hephaestus, Vedic Tvaṣṭṛ, Georgian/Nart Tlepsh (→ C82) — the IE divine craftsman

### 2.4 Dvoeverie — Dual Faith After Christianization [4/5 sources]

- After 988 CE, Slavic paganism did NOT disappear — it **merged** with Christianity
- **Perun** → absorbed into **St. Elijah** (Ilya the Prophet, who rides a chariot of fire/thunder across the sky)
- **Veles** → absorbed into **St. Blaise/Vlasiy** (patron of cattle — preserving Veles's pastoral function)
- **Mokosh** → **Paraskeva Pyatnitsa** (St. Friday)
- **Marzanna** (death/winter goddess) → rituals of drowning/burning a straw effigy survive to this day in Poland, Czech Republic
- **Kupala Night** (summer solstice): bonfires, river bathing, divination — pre-Christian festival thinly Christianized as "St. John's Eve"
- Church authorities condemned *dvoeverie* for centuries — proving its persistence

---

## 3. SPECULATIVE CLAIMS (Tier 3 — Possible but Unverified)

### 3.1 Rod — The Universal Creator [2/5 sources]

- **Rod** (Род, literally "birth/kin/clan"): proposed as the **supreme cosmic creator** above all other gods
- Mentioned in medieval sermons condemning paganism: "they put Rod and the Rozhanitsy ahead of all"
- **Rybakov** (1987) argued Rod was the **original monotheistic supreme deity** of the Slavs, later demoted
- **Contested**: other scholars see Rod as a minor ancestral spirit elevated by Rybakov's nationalistic framework
- If authentic, Rod would represent a **Slavic equivalent** of Vedic Ṛta/Brahman, Greek Chaos, or Chinese Tao

### 3.2 The Three Realms — Prav, Yav, Nav [2/5 sources]

The proposed Slavic cosmological model:
- **Prav** (Правь) = the upper/divine realm — the domain of gods, cosmic law, truth
- **Yav** (Явь) = the middle/manifest realm — the visible world, the living
- **Nav** (Навь) = the lower/dead realm — the underworld, ancestors, the unmanifest
- Connected by the **world tree** (oak) — Perun at the top, Veles at the roots (→ C53)
- **Warning**: this tidy tripartite scheme derives partly from the **Book of Veles** (see §4.1) and modern neopagan reconstruction — its authenticity as a pre-Christian concept is **debated**
- However, the terms *nav'* (dead/underworld) and *yav'* (manifest) DO appear in genuine medieval sources

### 3.3 Slavic-Baltic Religious Unity [3/5 sources]

- The Slavic and Baltic (Lithuanian/Latvian) mythological systems share **remarkable parallels**:
  - Perun ↔ Perkūnas (thunder god)
  - Veles ↔ Velnias (underworld/cattle god)
  - Mokosh ↔ Laima (fate goddess)
  - Dazhbog ↔ Saulė (sun)
- This suggests a **Proto-Balto-Slavic religious system** that predates the linguistic split (~1500–1000 BCE)
- Some scholars argue Baltic mythology preserves the system **more purely** due to Lithuania's late Christianization (1387) → C85

---

## 4. DUBIOUS CLAIMS (Tier 4 — No Credible Source)

### 4.1 The Book of Veles (Велесова Книга) [5/5 sources]

- The **Book of Veles**: a text allegedly written on **birch-bark tablets** in a pre-Cyrillic script, discovered in the 1920s
- Claims to be a **pre-Christian Slavic scripture** recording Slavic history from the 7th century BCE to the 9th century CE
- **Scholarly consensus**: it is a **forgery**, likely created by Yuriy Mirolubov in the mid-20th century
- The language is **anachronistic**, mixing modern Ukrainian/Russian with pseudo-archaic forms
- It is used extensively by **Slavic neopagans** (Rodnovery) but has NO academic credibility
- Assessment: **Tier 4** — confirmed forgery

### 4.2 Ancient Slavic Civilization Predating Sumer [0/5 sources]

- Pseudohistorical claims (popular in certain Russian/Ukrainian nationalist circles) that the Slavs had an **advanced civilization** older than Sumer, with their own writing and science
- No archaeological, genetic, or linguistic evidence supports this — the earliest Slavic-speaking populations are attested from the **5th–6th century CE** archaeological record
- Assessment: **Tier 4** — nationalistic pseudohistory
