## QUICK SUMMARY

The **Great Plains** of North America — stretching from the Canadian prairies to Texas, from the Rocky Mountain foothills to the Mississippi — sustained some of the most **mobile, ceremonially rich, and militarily sophisticated** indigenous cultures on Earth. While many Plains peoples (Lakota, Cheyenne, Crow, Comanche, Blackfoot, Arapaho, Pawnee, Kiowa) adopted horse culture only after Spanish contact (~1600-1750 CE), their cosmological and ceremonial systems draw on far older traditions. At the center of Plains spirituality is the **vision quest** (*hanbleceya* in Lakota — "crying for a vision"): a solitary ordeal of fasting, prayer, and exposure on a hilltop seeking **direct personal revelation** from the spirit world (→ K02, K15). The **Sun Dance** (*Wiwanyang Wacipi*) — the great collective ceremony involving fasting, dancing, and (among the Lakota and others) **piercing and flesh offering** — represents the most solemn act of community renewal and cosmic reciprocity. **Wakan Tanka** ("Great Mystery/Sacred") in Lakota theology is not a personified deity but the **totality of sacred power** pervading all existence — a sophisticated non-theistic concept remarkably similar to *Brahman* (Hinduism), *Tao* (Daoism), or *Ein Sof* (Kabbalah → N09). The **Sacred Pipe** (*chanunpa*), brought by **White Buffalo Calf Woman** (Ptesan-Wi), connects the smoker to all relations (*mitakuye oyasin* — "all my relatives") across the human, animal, plant, mineral, and spirit realms. The **suppression of Plains religion** by the U.S. government (Sun Dance banned 1883-1934; children forcibly removed to boarding schools → H07), the **Ghost Dance movement** (1890), and the **Wounded Knee Massacre** (1890) represent some of the most egregious acts of **cultural genocide** in modern history. Yet Plains traditions survived, revived, and continue as living practices today.

### 1.2 Core Cosmological Concepts [5/5 sources]

| Concept | Lakota Term | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Great Mystery** | Wakan Tanka | Not a personified god but the **totality of sacred power**; encompasses 16 aspects (Four Superior, Four Associates, Four Subordinate, Four Related); ineffable, beyond human comprehension |
| **Sacredness pervading all** | Wakan | Everything possesses varying degrees of *wakan* (sacred power); rocks, thunder, buffalo, humans — all participate in the sacred web |
| **Interconnection** | Mitakuye Oyasin | "All my relatives" — spoken at ceremonies; encompasses ALL beings (human, animal, plant, mineral, spirit); ethical foundation |
| **Sacred directions** | Tob Tob | Four cardinal directions (+ above, below, center = 7) each associated with colors, powers, animals, and spiritual qualities |
| **Earth as sacred** | Maka | Earth is a living being; Maka Ina (Mother Earth) — not metaphor but ontological reality |
| **Spiritual helpers** | Tunkan (stone spirits), Wakinyan (Thunder Beings), etc. | Spirits encountered in vision quest become lifelong helpers/guides; reciprocal relationship |

## 2. THE VISION QUEST

### 2.1 Hanbleceya — Crying for a Vision [5/5 sources]

| Stage | Practice | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Preparation** | Prospective quester approaches a holy man (*wicasa wakan*) for guidance; builds purification lodge; undergoes inipi (sweat lodge) | Spiritual cleansing; establishing intention; receiving instructions on where to fast |
| **Going out** | Taken to a remote hilltop; prayer ties (tobacco bundles on string) mark the sacred space; left alone with pipe, blanket, no food or water | Vulnerability before the spirits; removing all worldly distraction; demonstrating sincerity through suffering |
| **Duration** | Typically 1-4 days and nights (traditionally up to 4 days) | Longer quests demonstrate greater commitment; extreme thirst, cold/heat, fear, solitude break down ego defenses |
| **The vision** | May come as animal visitation, voice, visual revelation, dream, intuition, weather event, or absence (which itself has meaning) | Not every quest produces a dramatic vision; the experience is interpreted with the help of the holy man afterward |
| **Return** | Quester is retrieved; undergoes inipi again; shares vision with holy man; receives interpretation and instructions | The vision may prescribe a new name, a lifelong obligation, a medicine bundle, a song, or a specific role in the community |

### 2.2 The Vision Quest Across Plains Nations [4/5 sources]

| Nation | Variation |
|--------|-----------|
| **Crow** | Particularly intense vision quest tradition; questers might cut off a finger joint as offering; visions directly shaped social status and military strategy |
| **Cheyenne** | Vision quest connected to Sacred Arrows and tribal renewal; Sweet Medicine's original vision established Cheyenne law |
| **Blackfoot** | Vision quests preceded Sun Dance participation; thunder dream = special power; beaver bundle visions |
| **Pawnee** | Vision quest tradition present but less emphasized than star ceremonialism; animal lodge societies derived from collective visionary experience |

## 3. THE SUN DANCE

### 3.1 Wiwanyang Wacipi — The Sun Gazing Dance [5/5 sources]

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Timing** | Annually at summer solstice (typically); multi-day preparation + 4 days of ceremony |
| **Sacred Tree** | A cottonwood tree is ceremonially selected, "captured" (treated as an enemy warrior), felled, and erected as the center pole — representing the **axis mundi** (→ C53) connecting earth and sky |
| **Dance** | Participants dance facing the sun from dawn to dusk for up to 4 days; no food or water; eagle-bone whistles blown continuously; chanting and drumming |
| **Piercing** (Lakota, some others) | Wooden skewers inserted through chest or back flesh; attached by rawhide thongs to the center pole; dancer leans back until flesh tears free — offering one's body as the only thing truly one's own; NOT "self-torture" but **sacrifice for the people** |
| **Purpose** | Renewal of the world; fulfillment of a vow (pledged during crisis); ensuring the buffalo return; cosmic reciprocity — "I give so the people may live" |
| **Attendance** | The entire community gathers; social, political, and economic activities occur alongside the ceremony |

### 3.2 U.S. Government Suppression [4/5 sources]

- **1883:** Secretary of Interior Henry Teller's "Courts of Indian Offenses" — Sun Dance and other ceremonies banned
- **1884-1934:** Fifty years of suppression; ceremonies went underground or were disguised as "fairs"
- **1934:** Indian Reorganization Act partially reversed suppressive policies
- **1978:** American Indian Religious Freedom Act (AIRFA) — finally granted legal protection to Native religious practices
- Despite suppression, the Sun Dance was **never completely abandoned** — it was practiced covertly, especially among the Lakota, and revived strongly after 1978

## 4. SACRED PIPE, MEDICINE WHEEL

### 4.1 The Sacred Pipe — Chanunpa [5/5 sources]

- **White Buffalo Calf Woman** (Ptesan-Wi) brought the Sacred Pipe to the Lakota people, along with Seven Sacred Rites
- The pipe bowl (red catlinite/pipestone) represents the Earth/feminine; the stem (wood) represents all that grows/masculine; when joined, they unite all creation
- Tobacco is offered to the six directions before smoking
- The Sacred Pipe of the Lakota nation is kept by the **Looking Horse family** at Green Grass, South Dakota — the 19th Keeper is Arvol Looking Horse (born 1954)
- The pipe is smoked in circles at all significant occasions; its smoke carries prayers upward

### 4.2 Medicine Wheel and Sacred Hoop [4/5 sources]

| Direction | Color (Lakota) | Association | Season |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|--------|

- Solar alignments mark summer solstice sunrise/sunset + solstice-era star rises (Aldeberan, Rigel, Sirius)
- Dated ~1200-1700 CE; likely used by multiple Plains nations
- Part of a network of high-altitude stone structures across the northern Plains → D06

## 5. PROPHECY, GHOST DANCE, AND RESISTANCE

### 5.1 Key Prophecy Traditions [4/5 sources]

| Tradition | Source | Content |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Hopi Prophecy** | Hopi elders (Arizona, though Puebloan not Plains) | Prophesied arrival of "white brother" (Pahana); warnings about technology, nuclear weapons ("gourd of ashes"), and environmental destruction; the "Great Purification" |
| **Black Elk's Vision** | Nicholas Black Elk (Oglala Lakota, 1863-1950) | At age 9, received a vast cosmic vision of the "sacred hoop of the nation" and the "tree of life" at the center; prophesied the hoop would be broken but could be mended. Recorded by John Neihardt in *Black Elk Speaks* (1932) |
| **Sweet Medicine** (Cheyenne) | Foundational prophet | Received the Sacred Arrows and the Law at Bear Butte (SD); prophesied the coming of horses and the "spider-web people" who would change the world |
| **White Buffalo Calf Woman** | Lakota sacred narrative | Her return (signaled by the birth of a white buffalo calf) would herald a time of renewal and unity |

### 5.2 Ghost Dance [5/5 sources]

- **1889-1890:** **Wovoka** (Jack Wilson, Northern Paiute from Nevada) received a vision during a solar eclipse: if Native peoples danced the Ghost Dance, lived peacefully, and abandoned white ways, the dead would return, the buffalo would come back, and white people would vanish
- Spread rapidly across the Plains; the Lakota version (influenced by desperation of reservation confinement and starvation) included bulletproof "Ghost Shirts"
- U.S. government panicked; attempted to arrest Sitting Bull (killed Dec. 15, 1890) and Big Foot's band
- **Wounded Knee Massacre** (Dec. 29, 1890): 7th Cavalry killed ~250-300 Lakota men, women, and children at Wounded Knee Creek, South Dakota — one of the most tragic events in American history
- The massacre effectively ended the Ghost Dance movement but NOT Plains spirituality

## 6. COUNTER-ARGUMENTS AND SCHOLARLY DEBATE

| Claim | Supporting Evidence | Counter-Evidence | Assessment |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| Plains cosmology represents a sophisticated philosophical system comparable to world religions | Wakan Tanka concept parallels Brahman, Tao, Ein Sof; ethical framework (mitakuye oyasin) embraces all life; centuries of systematic development | Often dismissed or romanticized; oral tradition makes precise theology difficult to reconstruct; colonial disruption fragmented traditions | **Tier 1** — unquestionably a sophisticated system; comparative analysis is productive |
| The Sun Dance piercing is "self-torture" or "barbarism" | U.S. government used this framing to justify banning | Participants describe it as SACRIFICE (not torture); giving one's flesh for the people; voluntary; deeply meaningful; no more extreme than flagellation in Catholic tradition | **Tier 1** — framing as barbarism is a colonial projection; participants' testimony is clear |
| Hopi prophecies accurately predict modern events | Several prophecies match modern technology/events; "gourd of ashes" ≈ nuclear weapons; "spider web" ≈ internet | Prophecies are post-hoc interpreted to fit events; multiple versions exist; oral traditions are fluid; confirmation bias in matching | **Tier 2-3** — some matches are suggestive; others are stretched; prophecy literature requires critical handling |
| Vision quests produce genuine spiritual contact | Universal testimony of practitioners; physiological basis (fasting + dehydration + isolation → altered states); life-changing outcomes documented | Neuroscience can explain hallucinations under extreme conditions; cultural expectation shapes content | **Tier 2** — phenomenology is real; ontological status of entities encountered is philosophically debated |
