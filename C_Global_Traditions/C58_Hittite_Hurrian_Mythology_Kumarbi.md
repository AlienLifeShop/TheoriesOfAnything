## QUICK SUMMARY

The **Hittite and Hurrian mythological traditions**, preserved on cuneiform tablets from **Hattusa** (modern Boğazköy, Turkey), provide the crucial **"missing link"** between Mesopotamian and Greek mythology. The **Kumarbi Cycle** — a Hurrian composition translated into Hittite (~14th–13th century BCE) — tells of a **divine succession** in which the god **Kumarbi** overthrows **Anu** (the Sky God) by **biting off his genitals**, becoming pregnant with the storm god **Teshub**, who in turn overthrows Kumarbi. This narrative **directly parallels** Hesiod's *Theogony* (~700 BCE), where **Kronos** castrates **Ouranos** and is overthrown by **Zeus** — providing compelling evidence for the **transmission of Near Eastern mythological motifs into Greek tradition** (→ A17, C56). The continuation, the **Song of Ullikummi**, describes Kumarbi's revenge through a monstrous stone creature — paralleling the Typhon/Typhoeus episode in Greek myth. Hittite religion was itself a **syncretic system** absorbing Hattian, Hurrian, Mesopotamian, and Luwian deities — hosting a pantheon of "a thousand gods" and demonstrating how Bronze Age Anatolia functioned as a **cultural crossroads** transmitting ideas between East and West.

## 1. THE HITTITE EMPIRE — CONTEXT

### 1.1 Historical Overview [5/5 sources]

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Empire period** | ~1650–1178 BCE (Old Kingdom → New Kingdom → collapse in Bronze Age Collapse → E14) |
| **Capital** | Hattusa (modern Boğazköy, central Turkey) |
| **Language** | Hittite (oldest attested Indo-European language); also Hurrian, Hattian, Luwian, Akkadian |
| **Script** | Cuneiform (borrowed from Mesopotamia) + Anatolian Hieroglyphs (Luwian) |
| **Archive** | ~30,000 cuneiform tablets found at Hattusa — treaties, ritual texts, myths, prayers, laws |
| **Key treaties** | Treaty of Kadesh with Ramesses II (~1259 BCE) — world's earliest known peace treaty |
| **Military** | Chariot warfare; rivaled Egypt and Assyria |
| **Collapse** | ~1178 BCE — part of the Bronze Age Collapse (→ E14); Sea Peoples invasions |

### 1.2 The "Thousand Gods of Hatti" [5/5 sources]

Hittite religion was radically **syncretic** — absorbing deities from every culture they encountered:

| Layer | Origin | Key Deities |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Hattian** (pre-IE substrate) | Central Anatolia | Sun Goddess of Arinna (supreme); Telepinu (vegetation god); Inara (protectress) |
| **Hittite** (Indo-European) | Migrant IE speakers | Storm God of Hatti (IE thunder god); weather gods |
| **Hurrian** | Northern Mesopotamia/Syria | Teshub (storm), Kumarbi (grain/father), Hepat (queen), Shaushga (war/love = Ishtar) |
| **Mesopotamian** | Sumer/Akkad | Anu, Enlil, Ea/Enki, Ishtar — borrowed via Hurrians |
| **Luwian** | Western Anatolia | Tarhunt (storm god); related to Hittite pantheon |

## 2. THE KUMARBI CYCLE — KINGSHIP IN HEAVEN

### 2.1 The Song of Kumarbi (CTH 344) [5/5 sources]

The central Hurrian-Hittite myth — the **"Kingship in Heaven"** text — describes a succession of divine rulers:

**Succession of Divine Kings:**

| Generation | King | How Power Was Gained | How Power Was Lost |
|-----------|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **1st** | Alalu | Original ruler of heaven | Overthrown by Anu after 9 years |
| **2nd** | Anu | Defeated Alalu; sent him to the underworld | Overthrown by Kumarbi |
| **3rd** | Kumarbi | **Bit off Anu's genitals** as Anu fled; swallowed his seed | Became pregnant; gave birth to Teshub and others |
| **4th** | Teshub | Born from Kumarbi's body; grew to challenge his father | Becomes king of the gods; Kumarbi seeks revenge |

### 2.2 The Castration Scene — Key Passage [5/5 sources]

> *"Anu tried to fly up to heaven, but Kumarbi seized him by the feet and dragged him down. He bit off his 'manhood' (loins) and swallowed it. When Kumarbi had swallowed Anu's manhood, he rejoiced. But Anu turned to him and said: 'Do not rejoice over what you have swallowed! I have placed inside you three terrible gods: the Storm God (Teshub), the Tigris River (Aranzah), and Tasmisu.'"*

**Key Parallel to Greek Theogony:**
- Alalu → (no Greek equivalent, or possibly Chaos)
- **Anu → Ouranos** (Sky Father)
- **Kumarbi → Kronos** (castrates the sky god; swallows/contains offspring)
- **Teshub → Zeus** (storm god who overthrows the castrator)

### 2.3 The Birth Crisis [4/5 sources]

Kumarbi, now pregnant with three divine beings, undergoes a birth crisis:
- The Storm God (Teshub) threatens to burst from his skull (cf. Athena from Zeus's head)
- Alternate birth channels are discussed — mouth, "good place" (anus?)
- Ultimately Teshub is born and grows to challenge Kumarbi for kingship
- The earth and the "good place" are involved — obscured by tablet damage

## 3. THE SONG OF ULLIKUMMI

### 3.1 Kumarbi's Revenge (CTH 345) [5/5 sources]

After losing kingship to Teshub, **Kumarbi plots revenge** by creating a monstrous challenger:

| Episode | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Kumarbi's plan** | Mates with a great rock; begets **Ullikummi** — a diorite stone monster |
| **Ullikummi's growth** | Placed on the shoulder of **Upelluri** (an Atlas-like giant who holds up earth and heaven); grows enormously |
| **Ullikummi's assault** | Rises from the sea; threatens the gods; defeats Teshub in first battle |
| **Divine council** | Teshub goes to Ea (Enki) for help; gods convene (→ A16) |
| **The Cutting Tool** | Ea retrieves the **ancient copper cutting tool** (used to separate heaven from earth at creation) and cuts Ullikummi from Upelluri's shoulder, weakening him |
| **Final battle** | Teshub and the gods battle the weakened Ullikummi — text breaks off (tablet damaged) |

### 3.2 Parallels to Greek Myth [5/5 sources]

| Ullikummi Cycle | Greek Myth | Connection |
|-----------------|------------|------------|
| Stone monster born of Kumarbi to challenge Teshub | **Typhon/Typhoeus** — monster born of Gaia to challenge Zeus | Revenge of the displaced generation |
| Rises from the sea | Typhon sometimes emerges from the earth/sea | Chthonic origin |
| Initially defeats the storm god | Typhon initially defeats Zeus (in some versions) | Storm god temporarily humbled |
| Gods convene in alarm | Assembly on Olympus | Divine council → A16 |
| Ancient cutting tool separates heaven and earth | Kronos's sickle used to castrate Ouranos | Primordial weapon |
| Upelluri (holds heaven on shoulders) | **Atlas** (holds sky on shoulders) | World-bearer figure |

## 4. HITTITE STORM GOD TRADITIONS

### 4.1 The Illuyanka Myth — Dragon-Slaying (→ C56) [5/5 sources]

Two versions of the storm god's battle with the serpent/dragon Illuyanka:

**Version 1 (Older):**
- The Storm God is **defeated** by Illuyanka
- The goddess **Inara** prepares a feast to lure Illuyanka out
- A mortal man (Hupasiyas) helps trap the dragon
- The Storm God returns and kills the bound Illuyanka

**Version 2 (Later):**
- Illuyanka **steals the Storm God's heart and eyes** after defeating him
- The Storm God's son marries Illuyanka's daughter, and she obtains the stolen organs
- The restored Storm God fights Illuyanka again; his own son stands with the dragon
- The Storm God kills both Illuyanka and his own son

### 4.2 IE Storm-God Pattern Alignment (→ C56) [4/5 sources]

| Element | Hittite | Vedic | Greek | Norse |
|---------|---------|-------|-------|-------|
| Storm God | Storm God of Hatti / Teshub | Indra | Zeus | Thor |
| Serpent/Dragon | Illuyanka | Vritra | Typhon/Python | Jörmungandr |
| Initial defeat | Yes (Storm God loses organs) | No (Indra victorious throughout) | Yes (Typhon version) | Yes (mutual kill at Ragnarok) |
| Helper/trick | Inara + mortal | No | Athena/Hermes | No |
| Cosmic stakes | Restoration of divine power | Release of waters | Supremacy of Olympians | End/renewal of world |

### 4.3 Telepinu — The Vanishing God [4/5 sources]

A uniquely Hittite myth type: **Telepinu** (vegetation/agriculture god) becomes angry and disappears:
- Crops fail; animals become barren; gods starve
- The bee finds Telepinu and stings him awake (a ritually significant detail)
- Telepinu's anger is ritually purged; fertility returns
- **Parallel:** Demeter's withdrawal in grief (Persephone myth); Amaterasu hiding in cave (→ A15)

## 5. THE MISSING LINK — MESOPOTAMIA TO GREECE

### 5.1 The Transmission Chain [5/5 sources]

The Kumarbi Cycle demonstrates a **clear chain of mythological transmission**:

```
Sumerian/Akkadian → Hurrian → Hittite → [intermediaries?] → Greek

An/Anu (Sky God)  →  Anu    →  Anu    →     →  Ouranos
Enlil/Ea         →  Kumarbi →  Kumarbi →     →  Kronos
Ninurta/Marduk   →  Teshub  →  Teshub  →     →  Zeus
                 →  Ullikummi→ Ullikummi→    →  Typhon
                 →  Upelluri →  Upelluri→     →  Atlas
```

### 5.2 How Did the Myths Travel? [4/5 sources]

| Route | Evidence | Period |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Phoenician/Levantine trade** | Phoenicians traded extensively with Greece; Ugaritic texts (→ A17) show the same motifs | ~1200–800 BCE |
| **Cilician connection** | Typhon's lair was placed at Cilicia (southeastern Turkey) — Hittite territory | Greek memory of the source region |
| **Mycenaean-Hittite contact** | Ahhiyawa letters show Mycenaean-Hittite diplomatic contact (→ C42) | ~14th–13th century BCE |
| **Dark Age intermediaries** | Neo-Hittite states (Carchemish, etc.) preserved traditions; Aramaic-speaking peoples transmitted | ~1100–800 BCE |

### 5.3 Hesiod's Debt [5/5 sources]

**Hesiod's Theogony** (~700 BCE) shows clear structural debts to Near Eastern tradition:

| Hesiod's Theogony | Near Eastern Source | Parallel Type |
|---|---|---|
| Ouranos castrated by Kronos | Anu castrated by Kumarbi | Direct structural parallel |
| Kronos swallows children | Kumarbi swallows Anu's seed/children | Ingestion of divine offspring |
| Zeus overthrows Kronos | Teshub overthrows Kumarbi | Youngest-son defeats father |
| Typhon vs. Zeus | Ullikummi vs. Teshub | Monster challenges new king |
| Atlas holds sky | Upelluri holds heaven | World-bearer |
| Succession of divine kings | Alalu → Anu → Kumarbi → Teshub | Divine dynastic narrative |

This is not coincidence — the **structural, sequential, and specific** parallels demonstrate literary transmission.

---

## 6. COUNTER-ARGUMENTS AND SCHOLARLY DEBATE

| Claim | Supporting Evidence | Counter-Evidence | Assessment |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| Kumarbi Cycle was transmitted to Greece | Structural parallels too specific for coincidence; intermediary contacts documented; geographic continuity | Greeks could have inherited PIE mythic structures independently; specific transmission route unclear | **Tier 1** — scholarly consensus strongly favors transmission |
| Hittite religion was uniquely syncretic | "1000 gods of Hatti"; absorbed every tradition they encountered; multilingual rituals | All ancient religions were somewhat syncretic; Hittites are better documented | **Tier 1** — degree of syncretism exceptional even in ancient context |
| Troy/Bronze Age Collapse disrupted but did not destroy transmission | Neo-Hittite states preserved culture; Phoenicians maintained trade routes with Greece | 400-year "Dark Age" gap is problematic; oral transmission uncertain | **Tier 1-2** — multiple routes plausible; exact mechanism debated |
| IE storm-god myth is a single ancestral pattern | Indra, Teshub, Zeus, Thor all fight serpent/dragon | Hurrian Teshub is NOT Indo-European; may be convergent evolution | **Tier 2** — pattern is IE, but non-IE traditions contributed significantly |
| Understanding Hittite myths transforms interpretation of Greek myth | Shows Greek "originals" were Near Eastern borrowings | Greeks transformed borrowed material into something genuinely new | **Both true** — borrowing and creative transformation are not mutually exclusive |
