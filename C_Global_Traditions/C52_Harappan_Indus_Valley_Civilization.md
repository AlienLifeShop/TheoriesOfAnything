## QUICK SUMMARY

The **Indus Valley / Harappan Civilization** (c. 3300–1300 BCE, mature phase 2600–1900 BCE) was the **largest** of the three great Bronze Age civilizations — at its peak covering ~1.25 million km², with an estimated population of 5 million people across **1,500+ known sites**. Its two largest cities, **Mohenjo-daro** and **Harappa**, demonstrate **urban planning** unmatched until the Roman era: grid-aligned streets, standardized brick sizes, sophisticated **drainage systems**, public baths, granaries, and uniform weights and measures. Despite this extraordinary material sophistication, the civilization remains **half-silent** — its script (found on ~4,000 seals and artifacts) is **undeciphered**, meaning we cannot read a single word written by these people (→ D20). The famous **"Pashupati Seal"** depicting a horned figure in yogic posture surrounded by animals has been controversially identified as a **Proto-Shiva** figure (→ C11), linking Harappan religion to later Hinduism. The civilization's **decline** (~1900 BCE onward) coincides with the drying of the Ghaggar-Hakra river system and possibly the arrival of Indo-Aryan speakers — one of archaeology's most politically charged debates (→ A20, L02).

## 1. DISCOVERY AND CHRONOLOGY

### 1.1 Excavation History [5/5 sources]

| Year | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1826 | Charles Masson visits Harappa | First European notice — thought it was a "Brahmanical" ruin |
| 1856 | Railway construction | Harappa bricks used as ballast — massive destruction |
| 1921 | Daya Ram Sahni excavates Harappa | First systematic archaeology |
| 1922 | R. D. Banerji excavates Mohenjo-daro | Second great city discovered |
| 1924 | John Marshall announces civilization | *Illustrated London News* — the "Indus Valley Civilization" |
| 1947 | Partition | Sites split between India and Pakistan — complicates research |
| 2014–2019 | Rakhigarhi excavations | Largest Harappan site yet (350 hectares, in India); aDNA study |

### 1.2 Chronological Phases [5/5 sources]

| Phase | Dates (BCE) | Key Features |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| **Mehrgarh** (pre-Harappan) | 7000–2600 | Neolithic farming → copper age; among world's earliest agricultural villages |
| **Early Harappan** | 3300–2600 | Regional cultures converge; Kot Diji, Amri |
| **Mature Harappan** | 2600–1900 | Urban phase: great cities, standardized script, trade networks |
| **Late Harappan** | 1900–1300 | De-urbanization, scripts fade, sites reduce, rural continuity |

## 2. URBAN PLANNING AND ENGINEERING

### 2.1 City Layout [5/5 sources]

Harappan cities demonstrate remarkable **standardization** across vast distances:

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Grid plan** | Major streets at right angles; main streets ~10 m wide |
| **Brick standardization** | Ratio 1:2:4 maintained across ALL sites (from Ganweriwala to Lothal) |
| **Citadel + Lower city** | Two-tier layout: elevated western "citadel" + larger eastern residential area |
| **Drainage** | Underground covered drains from individual houses → main street drains → soak pits. **Most sophisticated pre-Roman sanitation** |
| **Wells** | ~700 wells excavated at Mohenjo-daro alone; some lined with wedge-shaped bricks |

### 2.2 Key Structures [5/5 sources]

| Structure | Location | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Great Bath** | Mohenjo-daro | 12 × 7 × 2.4 m pool, bitumen waterproofing, changing rooms — likely ritual purification (→ Hindu ghats?) |
| **Great Granary** | Harappa / Mohenjo-daro | Massive raised-floor buildings — but "granary" function disputed; no grain found |
| **Dholavira water reservoirs** | Gujarat, India | 16 reservoirs; water harvesting engineering for an arid environment — 48 hectares of water management |
| **Lothal dock** | Gujarat, India | Possible tidal dock (217 × 37 m) — earliest known maritime dock *if* interpretation is correct |

### 2.3 Engineering Precision (→ M03) [4/5 sources]

- Weight system: **Perfect binary/decimal hybrid** — 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 ... then 160, 320, 640 (ratio 0.8:1:2:4 ...; base unit ~13.63 g)
- Linear measure: **"Indus inch"** = 1.76 cm — accurately reproduced across sites 1,000+ km apart
- This level of standardization implies **central authority** — but no palaces, no royal tombs, no monumental inscriptions to kings have been found

## 3. THE INDUS SCRIPT — CIVILIZATION WITHOUT A VOICE

### 3.1 Characteristics [5/5 sources]

| Aspect | Data |
|--------|------|
| **Total texts** | ~4,000 inscribed objects (mostly seals, tablets, copper tablets, pottery) |
| **Unique signs** | 400–600 (depending on whether some are sign variants or distinct) |
| **Average text length** | ~5 signs (longest: ~26 signs) |
| **Direction** | Right to left (based on sign compression at left end) |
| **Type** | Probably **logologo-syllabic** (like early Sumerian) — too many signs for an alphabet, too few for pure logography |

### 3.2 Why It Remains Undeciphered [5/5 sources]

1. **No bilingual text** (no Rosetta Stone equivalent)
2. **Extremely short inscriptions** — insufficient for statistical/cryptographic analysis
3. **Unknown underlying language** — candidates include Proto-Dravidian, Indo-Aryan, Munda, isolate
4. **Hundreds of proposed decipherments** — none achieving scholarly consensus
5. **Asko Parpola's Proto-Dravidian hypothesis** is the most developed but not proven

### 3.3 Is It Even Writing? [3/5 sources]

Steve Farmer, Richard Sproat, and Michael Witzel (2004) controversially argued the Indus symbols represent **non-linguistic notation** (like heraldic emblems) rather than true script. This claim was strongly contested by Parpola, Rao, and others who demonstrated statistical patterns consistent with linguistic encoding.

## 4. ART, SEALS, AND RELIGIOUS INTERPRETATION

### 4.1 The Seal Tradition [5/5 sources]

Indus seals are the civilization's most characteristic artifacts:
- **Material:** Steatite (soapstone), fired and glazed
- **Size:** ~2–3 cm square
- **Common motifs:** Unicorn-like animal (most frequent), humped bull, elephant, rhinoceros, tiger, water buffalo, composite creatures
- **Function:** Trade/administrative identification (analogous to Mesopotamian cylinder seals)

### 4.2 The "Pashupati Seal" — Proto-Shiva Debate [5/5 sources]

**Seal M-304** from Mohenjo-daro shows:
- A figure seated in a **cross-legged "yogic" posture** (padmasana?)
- **Horned headdress** with plant or branch
- Surrounded by four animals: elephant, tiger, rhinoceros, water buffalo (and two deer beneath the seat)
- **Three faces** (or one face with hair swept to sides)

**John Marshall (1931)** identified this as a **Proto-Shiva** figure — specifically connecting to Shiva as **Pashupati** ("Lord of Animals"):

| For Proto-Shiva | Against Proto-Shiva |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Yogic posture matches Shiva's meditation | Posture might be a standard seated position, not yoga |
| "Lord of Animals" like Pashupati | "Master of Animals" motif common across ancient Near East |
| Horns resemble Shaiva iconography | Horns appear on Mesopotamian, European, and African deities |
| Later Hinduism venerates lingam stones — possible Harappan phallic stones found | Phallic stones might be pestles or weights |

### 4.3 The "Priest-King" and Other Art [4/5 sources]

- **"Priest-King"** bust (Mohenjo-daro): Bearded male figure with trefoil-patterned robe, head-band, armband — only known "portrait sculpture." But was he really a priest or king? We cannot know
- **Dancing Girl** (Mohenjo-daro): Bronze figure of a nude young woman with bangles — remarkable naturalism
- **Terracotta figurines:** Mostly female with elaborate headdresses — possible mother-goddess cult (→ C31), but again interpretation is uncertain

## 5. TRADE NETWORKS AND EXTERNAL CONTACTS

### 5.1 Mesopotamian Connection [5/5 sources]

| Evidence | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Dilmun, Magan, Meluhha** | Mesopotamian texts reference trade with "Meluhha" — identified as the Indus region |
| **Indus seals in Mesopotamia** | Found at Ur, Kish, and other Mesopotamian sites |
| **Mesopotamian artifacts in Indus** | Cylinder seals, etched carnelian beads |
| **Gulf trade intermediaries** | Bahrain (Dilmun) served as middleman; 4,000+ Harappan-linked artifacts found |
| **Lothal bead factory** | Carnelian bead production for export — beads found from Ur to Gonur Depe |

### 5.2 Other Contacts [4/5 sources]

- **Central Asian trade:** Turquoise and lapis lazuli from Afghanistan/Iran; Indus artifacts at Shortugai (Afghanistan's Amu Darya)
- **Oman (Magan):** Copper source; Indus-type storage jars found at Ras al-Jinz
- **Internal network:** Shell bangles (Gujarat coast) found 1,500 km inland; standardized weights demonstrate a unified economic zone

## 6. DECLINE AND THE ARYAN QUESTION

### 6.1 Decline Factors [5/5 sources]

| Factor | Evidence | Assessment |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **River shift** | Ghaggar-Hakra (possibly Vedic Sarasvati) dried ~2000–1900 BCE | **STRONG** — many sites cluster along this lost river |
| **Climate change** | Weakening monsoon documented in paleoclimate records | **STRONG** — links to broader 4.2 ka event |
| **Tectonic activity** | Earthquake evidence at Mohenjo-daro (shifted Indus course?) | **MODERATE** |
| **Trade collapse** | Synchronous with Akkadian Empire collapse and broader Bronze Age disruption | **MODERATE** |
| **Internal factors** | De-urbanization visible before external factors peak | **UNKNOWN** |

### 6.2 The Aryan Migration/Invasion Debate [5/5 sources]

One of archaeology's most politically charged questions:

| Position | Key Evidence | Problems |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Aryan Invasion (Wheeler)** | "Massacre" skeletons at Mohenjo-daro; Vedic texts describe conquering *dāsa* (dark-skinned enemies) | Skeletons reanalyzed — not massacre evidence; no destruction layers matching invasion |
| **Aryan Migration (consensus)** | aDNA shows steppe (Yamnaya) ancestry arriving ~2000–1500 BCE; IE linguistics | Gradual migration, not conquest; coexistence period |
| **Out of India (Hindutva)** | Continuity of some cultural elements (fire altars, yoga?); political motivation to claim indigenous IE | Contradicts linguistic, genetic, and archaeological evidence; politically motivated |
| **Multi-causal decline** | Combination of environmental, economic, and demographic factors | **Most accepted** — no single cause |

**Rakhigarhi aDNA (2019):** Showed that the Mature Harappan individual lacked steppe ancestry — confirming that the Harappan population was **not** Indo-European. Steppe-derived ancestry appears in South Asia only after ~2000 BCE (→ L02, A20).

## 7. COUNTER-ARGUMENTS AND SCHOLARLY DEBATE

| Claim | Supporting Evidence | Counter-Evidence | Assessment |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| Indus script encodes language | Statistical patterns match linguistic encoding; 400+ signs = logosyllabic | Short texts; no bilingual; Farmer et al. "non-linguistic" argument | **Tier 2** — probably linguistic but unproven |
| Pashupati seal = Proto-Shiva | Yogic posture, Lord of Animals, horned deity → Shaivism | Near Eastern "Master of Animals" widespread; interpretation projection | **Tier 2** — possible but uncertain |
| Harappan civilization was egalitarian | No palaces, royal tombs, or monumental images of rulers | Variation in house size, burial goods; "citadel" suggests hierarchy | **Tier 2** — less hierarchical than peers, not egalitarian |
| Harappan religion → Hinduism | Great Bath → ghat ritual; terracotta → mother goddess; lingam stones; Pashupati | 1,000+ year gap; Vedic religion has distinct steppe origins; evidence indirect | **Tier 2** — some continuity likely, direct derivation unproven |
| The civilization was "peaceful" | No weapons depicted in art; no fortification at most sites; no conquest imagery | Arrowheads, spearheads found; "citadels" are fortified; absence of war art ≠ absence of war | **Tier 2** — less militaristic in art, not necessarily peaceful |
