## QUICK SUMMARY

The Haudenosaunee (People of the Longhouse), commonly known as the Iroquois Confederacy, created one of the world's oldest continuous systems of participatory governance, uniting five — later six — nations under the Great Law of Peace (Gayanashagowa). Founded by the Peacemaker (Deganawida) and his spokesman Hiawatha, the Confederacy established 117 articles governing consensus decision-making, checks and balances between elder and younger "brother" nations, separation of powers between civil and war chiefs, and a prominent role for Clan Mothers who held authority to appoint and remove leaders. Wampum belts served as binding legal records and diplomatic treaties — a non-written but precisely structured information system. The Confederacy's influence on the framing of the United States Constitution, while debated by historians, was formally acknowledged by the U.S. Congress in 1988 (H. Con. Res. 331). The Haudenosaunee creation narrative — featuring Sky Woman, the Twin Brothers (Sky-Holder/Sapling and Flint), and the world built on Turtle's back — constitutes a foundational example of the global Twin Mythology pattern.

## 1. VERIFIED CLAIMS (Tier 1 — Peer-Reviewed / Archaeological Record)

### 1.1 Historical Reality of the Confederacy [5/5 sources]
The Haudenosaunee Confederacy is well-attested through European contact records from the early 1600s onward (Jesuit Relations, Dutch/English colonial archives), extensive ethnographic documentation (Lewis Henry Morgan's *League of the Haudenosaunee* 1851, the earliest American ethnography), and ongoing living tradition. The original Five Nations — Mohawk (Kanien'kehá:ka), Oneida (Onyota'a:ka), Onondaga (Onöñda'gega'), Cayuga (Gayogo̱hó:nǫ'), and Seneca (Onödowá'ga:) — were joined by the Tuscarora around 1722 to form the Six Nations.

### 1.2 The Great Law of Peace — Structure and Content [4/5 sources]
The Gayanashagowa is an oral constitution of 117 articles (codicils) governing the Confederacy. It establishes: a Grand Council of 50 sachems (chiefs) with fixed numbers per nation; a bicameral-like deliberation process with "elder brothers" (Mohawk, Onondaga, Seneca) and "younger brothers" (Oneida, Cayuga, Tuscarora); consensus-based decision-making; rights of recall; and war/peace separation of powers. Wampum strings and belts accompany the recitation and ratify its provisions.

### 1.3 Clan Mother Authority [4/5 sources]
Haudenosaunee society is matrilineal: lineage, clan membership, and property pass through the mother's line. Clan Mothers (senior women of each clan) hold the authority to nominate sachems, counsel them, and — critically — remove them from office if they fail their duties ("dehorning"). This power of removal constitutes a pre-European form of impeachment with no direct parallel in other ancient governance systems known at the time of European contact.

### 1.4 Wampum as Record and Treaty [4/5 sources]
Wampum (cylindrical beads made from quahog clamshell and whelk) served multiple functions: mnemonic devices for oral laws and treaties, diplomatic credentials, condolence gifts, and ceremonial objects. The Two Row Wampum (Kaswentha), presented to the Dutch in 1613, established the metaphor of two vessels (canoe and ship) traveling side by side without interference — an early articulation of sovereignty and mutual respect (→ P17).

### 1.5 Creation Narrative: Sky Woman and the Twins [4/5 sources]
The Haudenosaunee creation account, recorded in numerous versions by Hewitt, Cusick, Parker, and contemporary traditionalists, describes Sky Woman falling from the Sky World through a hole created when the celestial tree was uprooted. Animals on the water below build a world on Turtle's back (Turtle Island) for her. Her grandsons — Sapling (Sky-Holder/Tharonhiawakon) and Flint (Tawiskaron) — embody creative and destructive principles and shape the world through their rivalry (→ C55).

## 2. CREDIBLE CLAIMS (Tier 2 — Academic / Debated but Supported)

### 2.1 Founding Date: ~1142 CE [3/5 sources]
Traditional dating placed the Confederacy's founding vaguely "before European contact." In 1997, Barbara Mann and Jerry Fields proposed 1142 CE based on a total solar eclipse visible in Haudenosaunee territory (August 31, 1142), which they identified with the "darkness" described during the Peacemaker's mission. This date is supported by some oral tradition keepers and archaeological evidence of reduced inter-village warfare after ~1150 CE, but remains debated. Other scholars propose dates ranging from the 12th to 16th century.

### 2.2 Influence on U.S. Constitution [3/5 sources]
U.S. Congressional Resolution H. Con. Res. 331 (1988) states: "the confederation of the original thirteen colonies into one republic was influenced... by the political system developed by the Iroquois Confederacy." Benjamin Franklin, who attended the 1744 Treaty of Lancaster where Canasatego advised colonial unity, explicitly referenced the Confederacy model. John Adams studied Iroquois governance. However, historians debate the *degree* of influence versus classical and Enlightenment sources (Locke, Montesquieu, Roman Republic). The debate is legitimate and ongoing, not settled in either direction.

### 2.3 The Peacemaker Narrative as Historical Memory [3/5 sources]
The story of Deganawida (the Peacemaker), who came across Lake Ontario in a white stone canoe, ended cycles of warfare and cannibalism, and — with Hiawatha and the Clan Mother Jigonsaseh — united warring nations, functions simultaneously as founding myth and historical account. Its narrative structure (a reformer confronting violence, converting opponents one by one, founding a new order) parallels accounts of other historical-legendary lawgivers (Moses, Lycurgus, Manu).

### 2.4 Three Sisters Agriculture and Ecological Knowledge [3/5 sources]
The intercropping of corn, beans, and squash ("Three Sisters") practiced by the Haudenosaunee and other Northeastern peoples represents a sophisticated agroecological system: corn provides structure for beans to climb, beans fix nitrogen for corn and squash, and squash leaves suppress weeds and retain moisture. This system has been validated by modern agricultural science as highly efficient polyculture.

## 3. SPECULATIVE CLAIMS (Tier 3 — Possible but Unverified)

### 3.1 Deep Antiquity of the Confederacy [2/5 sources]
Some Haudenosaunee traditionalists assert the Confederacy is far older than even the 1142 CE date — potentially thousands of years old. While this aligns with internal oral tradition authority, no archaeological or external evidence currently supports founding dates before ~1000 CE. The question depends partly on how "Confederacy" is defined: formal constitutional union versus looser cooperative alliance.

### 3.2 Linguistic Encoding in Wampum Patterns [2/5 sources]
Some researchers have proposed that wampum bead patterns encode information more precisely than generally recognized — approaching a symbolic writing system rather than a mnemonic device. While wampum belts clearly carried specific, recoverable meanings (trained "readers" could recite associated texts), whether the geometric patterns constitute a formal code remains unresolved.

### 3.3 Global Governance Model Parallels [1/5 sources]
Broader comparisons between Haudenosaunee governance and other ancient federal systems — such as the Athenian Amphictyonic League, the Swiss Confederation, or even the United Nations — have been drawn by political theorists. While structurally suggestive, direct historical connections (other than the documented U.S. constitutional debate) are speculative.

## 4. DUBIOUS CLAIMS (Tier 4 — No Credible Source)

### 4.1 Haudenosaunee as Descendants of Lost Tribes or Atlanteans
19th-century speculations linking Iroquois peoples to the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel (e.g., Ethan Smith's *View of the Hebrews*, 1823) have no genetic, linguistic, or archaeological support and reflect colonial-era assumptions that Indigenous achievements required external origins.

### 4.2 Wampum as Currency
The persistent characterization of wampum as "Indian money" distorts its actual functions. While wampum acquired monetary uses in colonial trade contexts (the Dutch even counterfeited it), its primary pre-contact functions were diplomatic, legal, ceremonial, and mnemonic — not monetary.
