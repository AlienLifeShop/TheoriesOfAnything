## 1. THE PATTERN DEFINED

### 1.1 Frazer's Original Formulation

Sir **James George Frazer** (1854–1941), Scottish social anthropologist at Trinity College, Cambridge, produced what remains the single most influential work in comparative mythology: *The Golden Bough*. First published in 1890 as a two-volume study, it expanded through successive editions — a three-volume second edition in 1900, a twelve-volume third edition published between 1906 and 1915, and a single-volume abridged edition in 1922 that became the widely read popular version.

Frazer's central thesis concerned the figure of the **dying-and-rising god** — a deity who dies (often violently: dismembered, castrated, drowned, burned) and is subsequently resurrected or reborn. Frazer argued that this pattern reflected the **agricultural fertility cycle**: the death of vegetation in autumn or winter and its rebirth in spring. The god *was* the vegetation. His death was the death of the grain. His resurrection was the sprouting of new crops.

Frazer catalogued an enormous range of examples:
- **Osiris** (Egyptian) — murdered, dismembered, resurrected as lord of the dead
- **Adonis** (Phoenician/Greek) — killed by a boar, mourned, reborn
- **Attis** (Phrygian) — self-castration and death, followed by resurrection
- **Tammuz/Dumuzi** (Mesopotamian) — descent to the underworld, subsequent return
- **Dionysus** (Greek) — torn apart by Titans, reborn
- **Balder** (Norse) — killed, destined to return after the apocalypse

Frazer's method was comparative and cumulative: he piled example upon example, drawing parallels across cultures that had no historical contact, building the case that the pattern was universal. His implicit (and sometimes explicit) argument extended to Christianity: Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection fell within the same category. This implication made *The Golden Bough* both enormously popular and deeply controversial.

### 1.2 The Critical Counter-Argument: Jonathan Z. Smith

The most significant challenge to Frazer's category came from **Jonathan Z. Smith** (1938–2017), Robert O. Anderson Distinguished Service Professor of the Humanities at the University of Chicago, one of the most important scholars of religion of the 20th century.

In his landmark article **"Dying and Rising Gods"**, published in Mircea Eliade's *Encyclopedia of Religion* (1987, revised 2005), Smith dismantled Frazer's category systematically. His central arguments:

1. **No single deity clearly dies and rises in the same narrative.** Smith examined each case individually and argued that scholars had been conflating distinct phenomena:
   - Some gods die but do not return (Attis, in the earliest Phrygian versions)
   - Some gods disappear but do not clearly die (Adonis, in the earliest Greek versions)
   - Some gods descend to the underworld but this is not death-and-resurrection per se (Inanna/Ishtar)
   - Osiris does not truly "rise" — he becomes lord of the dead, not a living god restored to the upper world

2. **The category is a scholarly construction, not a native category.** No ancient culture used a term equivalent to "dying-and-rising god." The term was Frazer's invention, imposed on diverse material.

3. **Late attestation problem.** For several deities (Adonis, Attis), the earliest evidence of a *resurrection* comes from Christian-era sources (2nd–4th centuries CE). It is possible that the "resurrection" element was read into earlier myths by Christians or under Christian influence, rather than being original.

4. **Agricultural interpretation fails.** Osiris is not a vegetation deity; he rules the dead. Attis's cult is about self-castration and mourning, not crop cycles. Adonis's "gardens" (thalysia) are about ephemerality, not agricultural renewal.

Smith's article became enormously influential. For approximately two decades after its publication, the consensus in religious studies was that "dying-and-rising gods" was a discredited category — a Victorian-era comparative mythology error.

### 1.3 Mettinger's Rehabilitation

**Tryggve N.D. Mettinger** (born 1940), professor of Hebrew Bible at Lund University, Sweden, published *The Riddle of Resurrection: "Dying and Rising Gods" in the Ancient Near East* in 2001. This book directly challenged Smith's dismissal.

Mettinger's key arguments:

1. **The evidence for at least some cases is strong and pre-Christian.** Mettinger examined five deities in detail: **Baal** (Ugaritic texts, ~1400–1200 BCE), **Melqart** (Tyrian Baal, attested from at least 6th century BCE), **Adonis** (pre-Hellenistic Phoenician evidence), **Eshmun** (Phoenician healer god), and **Osiris** (Pyramid Texts, ~2400 BCE). For these Near Eastern deities, he argued the evidence for death AND subsequent return/revival is genuine and pre-dates Christianity by centuries to millennia.

2. **The pattern is not monolithic but real.** Mettinger distinguished between:
   - **Disappearing deities** (who vanish and return — Telepinu in Hittite myth)
   - **Dying-and-rising deities** (who die and are revived — Baal, Melqart)
   - **Dying deities** (who die but whose "resurrection" is ambiguous — Dumuzi/Tammuz)

3. **The pattern does not require uniformity.** The existence of significant parallels among Near Eastern cultures — where cultural contact and influence are well-documented — does not depend on every case being identical.

4. **Dumuzi/Tammuz is a genuine case** after accounting for the *Dumuzi's Dream* text and the alternate-months arrangement described in Sumerian sources (six months below, six months above).

Mettinger concluded: **"The category of dying and rising gods is not a phantom construct."** However, he explicitly limited his claim to the ancient Near East and argued that each case must be examined on its own textual merits.

### 1.4 The Current State of the Debate

The scholarly landscape post-Mettinger is divided:

- **Minimalists** (following Smith): the category remains problematic; each case should be studied individually without a comparative template
- **Moderate comparativists** (following Mettinger): the pattern is real for a cluster of Near Eastern deities with demonstrable cultural connections, but should not be universalized
- **Maximalists** (Frazer's descendants, rare in mainstream academy): the pattern is a global universal reflecting either a shared human experience, cultural diffusion, or an actual recurring event

**For this project**: regardless of whether a single "template" exists in the academic sense, the **recurrence of the pattern** across unrelated cultures is the empirical datum to be explained. Something about human experience — whether agricultural, psychological, shamanic, neurological, or cosmological — generates stories of beings who die and are reborn. The explanation for that recurrence is what matters.

## 2. NEAR EASTERN EXAMPLES

### 2.1 Osiris (Egyptian)

**Date of earliest attestation:** Pyramid Texts, ~2400–2300 BCE (Old Kingdom, 5th and 6th Dynasties). These are the oldest religious texts in the world.

**The Myth:**
Osiris was the first king of Egypt, son of Geb (earth) and Nut (sky), brother and husband of Isis. His brother **Set** (god of chaos, storms, the desert) murdered him — in the fullest version (Plutarch, *De Iside et Osiride*, ~100 CE), Set tricked Osiris into lying in a coffin at a banquet, sealed it, and threw it into the Nile. In a second assault, Set found Osiris's body, dismembered it into **fourteen pieces** (some versions say sixteen or forty-two), and scattered them across Egypt.

**Isis** (his wife/sister) searched for all the pieces, found thirteen (or all fourteen in some versions), and with the help of **Anubis** and **Thoth**, reassembled Osiris's body — the first mummification. She then used magic to conceive **Horus** from the reassembled corpse. (The missing piece in some versions is the phallus, swallowed by a Nile fish; Isis fashioned a replacement.)

Osiris did **not** return to the world of the living. He became the **lord of the Duat** — the underworld — and presided over the judgment of the dead (the *Weighing of the Heart* ceremony depicted in the Book of the Dead). He is, in this sense, both dead and alive: dead to the upper world, king of the lower.

**Significance for the Pattern:**
- Osiris is the **prototype** of the dying-and-rising god in the ancient Near East
- His death involves **dismemberment** — connecting to the cosmogonic dismemberment sub-pattern (§4)
- His "resurrection" is partial: he does not return to life among the living but rules a parallel realm
- Smith used this ambiguity to argue Osiris is NOT a dying-and-rising god; Mettinger countered that rulership of the Duat constitutes a form of continued life
- The son (Horus) who avenges and succeeds him creates a dynastic pattern: the living Pharaoh = Horus; the dead Pharaoh = Osiris

**Key texts:** Pyramid Texts (Utterances 213–222, 356–366, and others); Coffin Texts (Middle Kingdom, ~2055–1650 BCE); Book of the Dead (New Kingdom, ~1550–1070 BCE); Plutarch, *De Iside et Osiride* (~100 CE); reconstructions by J. Gwyn Griffiths, *The Origins of Osiris and His Cult* (1980).

### 2.2 Dumuzi/Tammuz (Sumerian/Akkadian)

**Date of earliest attestation:** Sumerian literary compositions from the Ur III period (~2112–2004 BCE) and Old Babylonian period (~2000–1600 BCE).

**The Myth:**
In *Inanna's Descent to the Netherworld* (Sumerian) and *Ishtar's Descent to the Underworld* (Akkadian), the goddess Inanna/Ishtar descends through the seven gates of the underworld to confront her sister Ereshkigal (→ C20, C25). She is killed and hung on a hook. She is eventually revived, but the rules of the underworld demand a substitute: someone must take her place.

Inanna returns to the upper world and finds her husband **Dumuzi** (Akkadian: **Tammuz**) sitting on her throne, not mourning her absence. In rage, she fixes the eye of death upon him and delivers him to the *galla* demons as her substitute.

In *Dumuzi's Dream*, Dumuzi has prophetic nightmares of his capture. He flees, is caught, and is taken to the underworld. His sister **Geshtinanna** offers to take his place, and a compromise is reached: Dumuzi spends **six months** in the underworld, Geshtinanna the other six. This is the canonical seasonal explanation: Dumuzi's absence corresponds to the dry season (summer in Mesopotamia, when vegetation withers); his return corresponds to the wet season (autumn rains, when vegetation revives).

**Biblical Reference:** In **Ezekiel 8:14**, the prophet has a vision of the Jerusalem Temple where, to his horror, he sees **Israelite women weeping for Tammuz** at the Temple gates. This passage confirms:
- The cult of Tammuz had penetrated Israelite religion by the 6th century BCE
- Ritual mourning for the dying god was practiced in Jerusalem itself
- The Israelite prophets regarded this as an abomination — evidence of the conflict between Yahwist monotheism and older Near Eastern traditions

**Key texts:** *Inanna's Descent to the Netherworld* (ETCSL 1.4.1); *The Dream of Dumuzi* (ETCSL 1.4.3); *Dumuzi and Geshtinanna* (ETCSL 1.4.1.1); S.N. Kramer, "The Death of Dumuzi" (1980); Bendt Alster, *Dumuzi's Dream* (1972).

### 2.3 Baal (Ugaritic/Canaanite)

**Date of earliest attestation:** The **Baal Cycle**, a series of clay tablets discovered at **Ras Shamra** (ancient Ugarit, in modern Syria) beginning in 1929. The tablets date to approximately **1400–1200 BCE** and are written in Ugaritic cuneiform.

**The Myth:**
Baal (Hadad), the storm god and king of the gods at Ugarit, is challenged by **Mot** (literally "Death"), the god of the underworld. Mot sends messengers ordering Baal to descend to his domain. Baal submits, descends, and is swallowed by Mot — he dies.

Baal's death triggers cosmic mourning. **El** (the supreme god) descends from his throne, pours dust on his head, and lacerates himself. Baal's sister-consort **Anat** searches for Baal, finds Mot, and attacks him: she cleaves him with a sword, winnows him with a sieve, burns him with fire, grinds him with millstones, and scatters him in a field — the imagery is explicitly agricultural (treating Mot as grain). Baal returns to life; he and Mot have a final battle that ends in a draw adjudicated by the sun goddess Shapash.

**Significance:**
- The agricultural imagery (grain-processing of Mot's body) is among the strongest evidence for Frazer's agricultural interpretation
- The seven-year cycle mentioned in some readings of the tablets may connect to E14 (cyclical destruction periods)
- Mettinger considers Baal the **strongest individual case** for a genuine dying-and-rising deity

**Key texts:** KTU 1.1–1.6 (Baal Cycle tablets); translations by Mark S. Smith, *The Ugaritic Baal Cycle* (1994, 2009); Dennis Pardee, *Ritual and Cult at Ugarit* (2002); N. Wyatt, *Religious Texts from Ugarit* (1998).

### 2.4 Adonis (Phoenician/Greek)

**Date of earliest attestation:** References to Adonis as a Greek cult figure appear from the 7th century BCE (Sappho, fragment 140). Pre-Greek Phoenician origins are attested but textually fragmentary.

**The Myth:**
Adonis was born from the **myrrh tree** — his mother **Myrrha** (or Smyrna) had been transformed into a tree after an incestuous union with her father King Cinyras (a story told most fully by Ovid, *Metamorphoses* 10.298–559). The infant Adonis was so beautiful that **Aphrodite** and **Persephone** both claimed him. Zeus (or Calliope, in some versions) decreed he would spend **one-third** of the year with each goddess and one-third alone — another seasonal division.

Adonis was killed by a **wild boar** (in some traditions sent by Artemis or Ares). From his blood sprang the anemone; from Aphrodite's tears (or mixed blood and tears), the rose.

**The Adonia** — the annual festival of Adonis — was celebrated across the Greek and Phoenician world. Women planted "**Gardens of Adonis**": shallow pots of fast-growing seeds (lettuce, fennel, wheat, barley) on rooftops. The seedlings sprouted quickly, withered quickly, and were thrown into the sea or springs along with figurines of Adonis. This ritual enacts the pattern: rapid growth → death → disposal/return to nature.

**Etymology:** *Adonis* derives from the Semitic word ***adon*** ("lord") — the same root as Hebrew ***Adonai*** ("my Lord"), a title used for Yahweh. This linguistic connection is significant: it suggests the name "Adonis" is not a proper name but a title, and that the cult originated in a Semitic-speaking (Phoenician/Canaanite) milieu before being adopted by the Greeks.

**Key sources:** Sappho, fragments; Theocritus, *Idyll 15* (the Adonia at Alexandria); Ovid, *Metamorphoses* 10; Lucian, *De Dea Syria* 6–8; W. Atallah, *Adonis dans la littérature et l'art grecs* (1966).

### 2.5 Attis (Phrygian)

**Date of earliest attestation:** The cult of Attis and Cybele was imported to Rome from Phrygia (central Anatolia) in **204 BCE**, when the Romans brought the sacred black stone of Cybele from Pessinus during the Second Punic War (following a Sibylline oracle). Earlier Phrygian evidence is attested archaeologically but not textually in full narrative form.

**The Myth (composite):**
Attis was a shepherd of extraordinary beauty, beloved by **Cybele** (the Great Mother, Magna Mater). In the most common version (Ovid, *Fasti* 4.221–246; Arnobius, *Adversus Nationes* 5; Pausanias 7.17), Attis was unfaithful or was driven mad by Cybele's jealousy. In his madness, he **castrated himself** beneath a pine tree and bled to death. Violets sprang from his blood.

**The Roman Festival (March 15–28):**
- **March 15 (Canna intrat):** Procession of reed-bearers (commemorating Attis's discovery among reeds)
- **March 22 (Arbor intrat):** A pine tree, representing Attis, was cut down, wrapped in bandages like a corpse, and decorated with violets
- **March 24 (Sanguis, "Day of Blood"):** Frenzied mourning; the *galli* (eunuch priests of Cybele) slashed themselves; some new initiates castrated themselves in ritual imitation of Attis
- **March 25 (Hilaria, "Day of Joy"):** Celebration of Attis's **resurrection** — the pine tree/Attis was "reborn"
- **March 26 (Requietio):** Day of rest
- **March 27 (Lavatio):** Ritual washing of Cybele's sacred image

**The Problem (from Smith's critique):** The earliest Phrygian versions of the myth do NOT include a resurrection. Attis simply dies. The resurrection element — the Hilaria — is attested only from the **Roman Imperial period** (2nd century CE onward). Smith argued this was Christian influence: as Christianity spread, pagan cults added resurrection narratives to compete.

Mettinger and others counter that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, and that the spring timing of the festival strongly implies a death-rebirth logic that likely pre-dates the Roman literary evidence.

**Key sources:** Ovid, *Fasti* 4; Catullus, *Carmen 63*; Pausanias, *Description of Greece* 7.17; Arnobius, *Adversus Nationes* 5; Maarten J. Vermaseren, *Cybele and Attis: The Myth and the Cult* (1977); Lynn Roller, *In Search of God the Mother* (1999).

### 2.6 Melqart (Phoenician)

**Date of earliest attestation:** Melqart (meaning "King of the City") was the patron deity of **Tyre** (in modern Lebanon). Herodotus visited the temple of Melqart at Tyre (~450 BCE) and identified him with Heracles (*Histories* 2.44). Epigraphic evidence (Phoenician inscriptions, coins) dates from the 9th–6th centuries BCE.

**The egersis:**
The most important evidence for Melqart as a dying-and-rising deity is the annual ceremony called the ***egersis*** (Greek: ἔγερσις, "awakening" or "raising"). **Josephus** (*Antiquities of the Jews* 8.5.3, *Against Apion* 1.18) records that King Hiram of Tyre (10th century BCE, contemporary of Solomon) "demolished the old temples and built new ones, and he was the first to celebrate the awakening (egersis) of Heracles [= Melqart] in the month Peritius."

This ceremony is also referenced by:
- **Menander of Ephesus** (2nd century BCE), who describes the annual burning and awakening of Melqart
- Coins from Tyre showing Melqart riding a hippocampus (sea-horse), apparently emerging from the sea
- The ritual involved **burning** an effigy or representation of the god, followed by his "awakening" — possibly enacted by a priest playing the role of Melqart

**Significance:** Melqart's egersis is one of the strongest pieces of evidence for a pre-Christian dying-and-rising deity ritual, because Josephus dates its institution to the 10th century BCE via Tyrian court records. Mettinger considers Melqart a pivotal case.

**Key sources:** Corinne Bonnet, *Melqart: Cultes et mythes de l'Héraclès tyrien en Méditerranée* (1988); C. Bonnet and H. Niehr, *Religionen in der Umwelt des Alten Testaments II* (2010).

## 3. GLOBAL EXAMPLES

### 3.1 Dionysus/Zagreus (Greek)

The case of Dionysus involves two distinct but intertwined traditions:

**Dionysus (Olympian):** Son of Zeus and the mortal Semele. Born from Zeus's thigh after Semele was destroyed by Zeus's lightning when she demanded to see his true form. Dionysus is the god of wine, ecstasy, theater, and ritual madness. He descends to the underworld to retrieve his mother Semele (another katabasis — C25).

**Zagreus (Orphic):** In the **Orphic theogony** — a tradition associated with Orphism, a mystery religion tracing its origins to the mythical poet Orpheus — Zagreus was the son of Zeus and Persephone. The **Titans**, incited by Hera, lured the infant Zagreus with toys (mirror, knucklebones, a top, a bull-roarer). They **dismembered him** and consumed his flesh (some accounts add: boiled and roasted). **Athena** saved his still-beating heart and brought it to Zeus, who either swallowed it himself (and then fathered Dionysus through Semele, making Dionysus the reincarnation of Zagreus) or used it to reconstitute the god directly.

Zeus struck the Titans with thunderbolts, reducing them to ash. From this ash, **humanity was created** — hence humans contain both a Titanic (material, chaotic) and a Dionysian (divine) element. Orphic practice aimed to purify the soul of its Titanic nature and liberate the divine spark (→ A03, Gnostic parallels).

**The dismemberment-reassembly pattern** is explicit: Zagreus is torn apart, his body literally consumed, and he is reborn as Dionysus. This parallels Osiris (dismembered by Set), Purusha (sacrificed and divided), and shamanic initiatory experiences (K15, where the shaman's body is torn apart by spirits and rebuilt).

**Key sources:** Orphic fragments collected in Otto Kern, *Orphicorum Fragmenta* (1922); Nonnus, *Dionysiaca* (5th century CE); Clement of Alexandria, *Protrepticus* 2.17–18; W.K.C. Guthrie, *Orpheus and Greek Religion* (1935/1993).

### 3.2 Baldr (Norse)

In the **Prose Edda** (Snorri Sturluson, ~1220 CE) and the **Poetic Edda** (*Völuspá*, *Baldrs draumar*), **Baldr** (Old Norse: Baldr, "lord, prince, brave") is the most beloved of the Æsir gods — beautiful, wise, and pure.

Baldr begins having dreams of his own death. His mother **Frigg** extracts oaths from every substance in the world not to harm Baldr — except **mistletoe**, which she considers too young and harmless to swear. The trickster **Loki** learns this, fashions a dart (or arrow) from mistletoe, and places it in the hand of the blind god **Höðr**, guiding his throw at Baldr during a game where the gods amuse themselves by hurling objects at the invulnerable Baldr. The mistletoe pierces Baldr, and he dies.

**Hermóðr** rides Sleipnir (Odin's eight-legged horse) to Hel to negotiate Baldr's release (→ C25, katabasis). Hel agrees on one condition: every being in the cosmos must weep for Baldr. All do — except a giantess named **Þökk** (universally assumed to be Loki in disguise), who says "Let Hel hold what she has." Baldr remains in the underworld.

However, **Völuspá** (the primary Norse creation-and-apocalypse poem) states that after **Ragnarök** (the destruction of the gods and the cosmos), a **new world** will rise from the sea, and Baldr will return from Hel to rule it:

> *Unsown fields will grow,*
> *Baldr will come back...*
> *(Stanza 62)*

Baldr's return after the cosmic destruction-and-renewal cycle connects directly to E12 (cyclical destruction) and E14 (world ages/Kali Yuga): the best of the old world survives through apocalypse to found the new.

### 3.3 Quetzalcoatl (Mesoamerican)

**Quetzalcoatl** (Nahuatl: "Feathered Serpent," from *quetzalli* "precious feather" + *coatl* "serpent") is one of the most complex figures in Mesoamerican religion, attested from the **Olmec period** (~1200–400 BCE) through the Aztec period (1325–1521 CE).

**Death and Resurrection Traditions:**

1. **Self-immolation at Tula:** In the *Annals of Cuauhtitlan* (16th-century Nahuatl text), Ce Acatl Topiltzin Quetzalcoatl — a priest-king of Tula (Tollan) — is tricked by Tezcatlipoca into drunkenness and incest. In shame, he leaves Tula and journeys eastward. At the coast, he immolates himself on a funeral pyre. His heart rises into the sky and becomes the **Morning Star** (Venus). Alternatively: he departs on a raft of serpents, promising to return.

2. **Descent to Mictlan:** In the *Leyenda de los Soles* (Legend of the Suns), Quetzalcoatl descends to **Mictlan** (the underworld, realm of Mictlantecuhtli, Lord of the Dead) to retrieve the **bones of the previous humanity**. He grinds the bones and mixes them with his own blood (drawn from his penis) to create the humans of the Fifth Sun. This descent-retrieval-blood-sacrifice pattern combines katabasis (C25) with dying-god sacrifice.

The Venus connection is astronomically precise: Venus disappears below the horizon for approximately 8 days during inferior conjunction (between evening star and morning star phases). The ancient Mesoamericans tracked this disappearance obsessively (the Dresden Codex contains detailed Venus tables). Quetzalcoatl's death = Venus's disappearance; his resurrection as Morning Star = Venus's reappearance. This is not merely metaphorical — it is tied to an observable astronomical cycle (→ C21, Venus/Morning Star).

### 3.4 Nommo Semi (Dogon)

The **Dogon** people of the Bandiagara Escarpment in Mali (West Africa) have an intricate cosmogonic mythology documented primarily by **Marcel Griaule** (1898–1956) in *Conversations with Ogotemmêli* (1948, published in French as *Dieu d'eau*) and by Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen in *The Pale Fox* (*Le Renard pâle*, 1965).

In Dogon cosmogony, the creator god **Amma** created the **Nommo** — eight primordial ancestor-spirits associated with water. One of them, **Nommo Semi**, was **sacrificed**: his body was dismembered, and his body parts were scattered to the four cardinal directions to **purify the earth** after it had been defiled by the rebellious jackal-spirit Ogo (Yurugu). Nommo Semi was subsequently **resurrected** and descended to earth in an "ark" along with the ancestors of humanity.

The dismemberment-purification-resurrection sequence parallels Osiris (dismemberment, scattering across Egypt) and Purusha (sacrifice that creates the cosmos). The descent in an "ark" connects to C24 (Dogon Nommo traditions), which explores the broader Nommo mythology including the controversial Sirius claims.

**Caution:** Griaule's ethnographic methods have been challenged by Walter van Beek ("Dogon Restudied: A Field Evaluation of the Work of Marcel Griaule," *Current Anthropology* 32, 1991), who was unable to replicate many of Griaule's findings among the Dogon. The dismemberment myth, however, appears in multiple independent sources and is less contested than the Sirius material.

### 3.5 Pangu (Chinese)

**Pangu** (盤古) is the primordial being in Chinese cosmogonic mythology, first attested in **Xu Zheng's** (徐整) *Sanwu liji* (三五歷紀, "Historical Records of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors"), written during the **Three Kingdoms period** (~220–280 CE), though the myth likely has older oral origins.

In the myth, the universe began as a cosmic egg of chaos (*hundun*, 混沌). Pangu grew within the egg for 18,000 years. When he awoke, he broke the egg apart: the light, clear elements rose to become **Heaven** (Yang); the heavy, turbid elements sank to become **Earth** (Yin). Pangu stood between them, growing taller each day for another 18,000 years, pushing heaven and earth apart.

When Pangu died, his body became the world:
- His breath = wind and clouds
- His voice = thunder
- His left eye = the sun
- His right eye = the moon
- His limbs = the four quarters of the earth and the mountains
- His blood = rivers
- His veins = roads
- His flesh = fields and soil
- His hair = stars and the Milky Way
- His skin and body hair = plants and trees
- His bones and marrow = minerals and gems
- His sweat = rain and dew
- His parasites (fleas) = humanity (in some versions)

This is pure **cosmogonic dismemberment** — the world-from-a-body pattern (§4). Pangu does not "rise" after death in the usual sense; his death IS creation. His sacrifice is total and permanent.

### 3.6 Purusha (Vedic)

**Rigveda 10.90** (the *Purusha Sukta*, "Hymn of the Cosmic Person"), composed approximately **1200–1000 BCE**, describes the sacrifice of the primordial being **Purusha** ("person, man, cosmic being"):

> *When they divided Purusha, how many portions did they make?*
> *What did they call his mouth, his arms? What did they call his thighs and feet?*
> *The Brahmin was his mouth, of both his arms was the Rajanya made.*
> *His thighs became the Vaishya, from his feet the Shudra was produced.*
> *(RV 10.90.11–12, Griffith translation)*

The sacrifice produces:
- From his mouth: the Brahmins (priestly class) and speech
- From his arms: the Kshatriyas (warrior class) and strength
- From his thighs: the Vaishyas (merchant/farming class)
- From his feet: the Shudras (servant class)
- From his mind: the moon
- From his eye: the sun
- From his breath: the wind
- From his navel: the atmosphere
- From his head: the sky
- From his feet: the earth

The sacrifice was performed by the gods themselves — a primordial cosmic ritual. Purusha is both the sacrificer and the sacrifice, the priest and the victim. This self-referential structure is unique among cosmogonic dismemberment myths.

### 3.7 Ymir (Norse)

In the **Prose Edda** (*Gylfaginning*, Snorri Sturluson, ~1220 CE) and the **Poetic Edda** (*Völuspá*, *Vafþrúðnismál*), the primordial frost giant **Ymir** (also called Aurgelmir) was the first living being, formed from the collision of fire (Muspelheim) and ice (Niflheim) in the primordial void (Ginnungagap).

Ymir was nourished by the primordial cow **Auðumbla**. From Ymir's body, other giants were born (from his sweat and the coupling of his feet). Auðumbla licked the salty ice blocks and freed **Búri**, grandfather of Odin.

Odin and his brothers **Vili** and **Vé** killed Ymir. From his corpse they fashioned the world:
- Flesh = earth
- Blood = sea and lakes (so much blood it drowned all the frost giants except Bergelmir)
- Bones = mountains
- Teeth/jaw fragments = rocks and boulders
- Skull = the dome of the sky (held up by four dwarves: Norðri, Suðri, Austri, Vestri)
- Brains = clouds
- Eyebrows = Midgard (the wall enclosing the human world)

The parallels to Purusha and Pangu are striking and have been extensively studied in comparative mythology (see §4).

### 3.8 Christ (Christian)

The crucifixion, death, and resurrection of **Jesus of Nazareth** (ca. 4 BCE – ca. 30/33 CE) is the central event of Christianity:
- **Death:** Crucifixion under Pontius Pilate, attested by the Gospels (Mark 15, Matthew 27, Luke 23, John 19), Paul's letters (1 Corinthians 15:3–8, written ~55 CE, the earliest textual evidence), and arguably by Tacitus (*Annals* 15.44, written ~116 CE) and Josephus (*Antiquities* 18.63–64, the *Testimonium Flavianum*, ~93 CE, though its authenticity is debated).
- **Three-day death:** Friday to Sunday morning. The "three days" motif recurs in many traditions (Jonah in the whale: Matthew 12:40; Inanna dead for three days in the underworld).
- **Resurrection:** The empty tomb discovered by women (Mary Magdalene in all four Gospels). Post-resurrection appearances to disciples (Paul lists witnesses in 1 Corinthians 15:5–8). Bodily resurrection (Luke 24:39: "Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones").

**The comparative question:** Whether Jesus's death and resurrection was influenced by, derived from, or independent of pagan dying-and-rising god myths has been debated for over two centuries:
- **History of Religions School** (Religionsgeschichtliche Schule, late 19th/early 20th century): scholars like Richard Reitzenstein and Wilhelm Bousset argued direct influence from mystery cults (Osiris, Attis, Mithras)
- **Christian apologetics**: the pattern is a "preparation" by God (C.S. Lewis's argument: "Is it not strange that the one TRUE myth should be the one that actually happened?") or the cases are too dissimilar for influence
- **Smith's position**: the pagan "parallels" are overstated and mostly project Christian categories backward onto pre-Christian myths
- **Current consensus**: direct literary dependence is unlikely; structural similarity may reflect shared cultural context (the ancient Mediterranean) or shared human concerns (death, hope for survival)

## 4. COSMOGONIC DISMEMBERMENT — THE WORLD FROM A BODY

### 4.1 The Sub-Pattern

A specific subset of dying-and-rising (or dying-and-transforming) deity myths involves the creation of the physical world from the dismembered body of a primordial being. This is the **cosmogonic sacrifice**: the first being must die so that the cosmos can exist.

Attested examples:
| Tradition | Being | What the body becomes |
|-----------|-------|-----------------------|
| Vedic | Purusha | Cosmos, four castes, celestial bodies |
| Norse | Ymir | Earth, sea, sky, mountains, clouds |
| Chinese | Pangu | All natural features, plants, minerals |
| Babylonian | Tiamat | Sky (upper half of body), earth (lower half) — but killed by Marduk, who does not himself die |
| Dogon | Nommo Semi | Body parts scattered to purify earth |
| Orphic Greek | Zagreus / Titans | Humanity created from ash of Titans who consumed Zagreus |
| Iranian | Gayōmart | First man; from his body: metals, plants, the first human couple |

### 4.2 Bruce Lincoln's Indo-European Analysis

**Bruce Lincoln** (born 1948), Caroline E. Haskell Distinguished Service Professor at the University of Chicago Divinity School, published *Myth, Cosmos, and Society: Indo-European Themes of Creation and Destruction* (1986). Lincoln argued that the cosmogonic dismemberment myth is a specifically **Proto-Indo-European** (*PIE) heritage:

- The PIE myth involved a primordial being (reconstructed as **\*Yemo**, "twin") sacrificed by a primordial man (**\*Manu**, "man, thinker")
- Ymir (Norse) derives from *\*Yemo*; the name cognate is exact
- Purusha (Vedic) fills the same structural role
- The Iranian Gayōmart (from Avestan *Gaya Marətan*, "mortal life") is cognate
- Roman parallels: Romulus and Remus (twin sacrifice), though the cosmogonic element is replaced by city-founding

Lincoln's reconstruction is powerful and linguistically grounded. The *\*Yemo/\*Manu* pair is one of the best-established PIE mythological reconstructions, supported by comparative linguistics, structural analysis, and independent attestation in widely separated IE traditions (Indic, Iranian, Norse, Celtic, Roman).

### 4.3 Beyond Indo-European

However, **Pangu is NOT Indo-European**. Chinese belongs to the Sino-Tibetan language family. There is no linguistic or archaeological evidence for PIE influence on the Pangu myth. Similarly, the **Dogon Nommo Semi** dismemberment involves a West African tradition with no known IE contact.

This means one of:
1. **Independent invention**: the dismemberment-creation myth arises independently in unrelated cultures because it reflects a universal human intuition (the body as model for the cosmos; sacrifice as the price of creation)
2. **Deep diffusion**: the pattern spread via migration or trade routes far older than the IE dispersal (out-of-Africa cognitive template?)
3. **Experiential origin**: shamanic or altered-state experiences of bodily dismemberment (K15) provide the raw experiential data that each culture encodes in its cosmogony

### 4.4 The Meaning: Why Must the Giver Be Destroyed?

The cosmogonic dismemberment pattern converges with C18 (Prometheus/Forbidden Knowledge Archetype): the being who gives knowledge, creation, or life to humanity **suffers** for doing so. Prometheus has his liver torn out daily. Osiris is dismembered. Quetzalcoatl bleeds himself. Purusha is sacrificed. Zagreus is torn apart.

This raises a fundamental question for the project: **why does every tradition insist that the act of giving (knowledge, creation, fire, life) requires the giver's destruction?** Possible answers:
- **Thermodynamic**: creation requires the expenditure of energy; the giver is the fuel
- **Psychological**: the teacher must "die" (surrender authority) for the student to become independent
- **Shamanic**: the initiatory experience requires ego death before reconstruction (K17, K12)
- **Cosmological**: the ancient traditions are encoding a real observation — the universe began with a "sacrifice" (Big Bang as the "death" of a prior state?)

## 5. SHAMANIC PARALLELS

### 5.1 Initiatory Dismemberment

K15 documents a phenomenon found across shamanic traditions worldwide: the **shamanic initiatory crisis**, in which the aspiring shaman undergoes a visionary experience of being **dismembered by spirits** — bones stripped of flesh, organs removed and replaced, body reassembled with new components (crystal bones, serpent viscera, quartz eyes, extra organs).

**Mircea Eliade** documented this pattern extensively in *Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy* (1951/1964):

- **Siberian shamanism** (Yakut, Buryat, Tungus): spirits take the initiate to the underworld, boil the flesh from the bones, count the bones to verify completeness, and reassemble the shaman with new organs. If a bone is missing, the shaman will be "incomplete" and unable to heal certain diseases.
- **Australian Aboriginal** (Aranda, Wiradjuri): the initiate is "cut open" by ancestor spirits, internal organs removed and replaced with quartz crystals and magical substances. The initiate is "killed" and "reborn" as a medicine man.
- **South American** (various Amazonian traditions): the initiate is eaten by a jaguar, anaconda, or eagle, passes through their digestive system, and is expelled reborn. Alternatively: the initiate's body is pierced by magical darts (*tsentsak* among the Shuar/Jívaro) that become the tools of healing.
- **North American** (Ojibwe *Midewiwin* society): the initiate is symbolically "shot" with a white shell (*migis*) and "dies," then is revived by senior practitioners.

Eliade argued that shamanic initiatory dismemberment is **the defining feature of shamanism** — it is what distinguishes a shaman from a priest, prophet, or mystic. The shaman has **died and been remade**. This is not metaphor: the shaman's community understands that the shaman has genuinely undergone death and reconstruction.

### 5.2 The Connection to Dying-and-Rising Gods

The structural parallel is exact:
| Dying-and-Rising Deity | Shamanic Initiatory Crisis |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| God/hero dies | Initiate "dies" (soul journey, trance, illness) |
| Body dismembered or destroyed | Spirits dismember the body |
| Body reassembled or transformed | Spirits rebuild with new organs/powers |
| God returns from death with new status | Initiate returns as shaman with healing powers |
| God rules the underworld or gains cosmic role | Shaman gains access to spirit world |

This parallel suggests a hypothesis: **the dying-and-rising deity myth is the *mythologized version* of an experience that shamans have directly.** The shaman undergoes dismemberment and reassembly in visionary experience; when this experience is projected onto a cosmic scale, it becomes the myth of the dying god. When it is projected onto the natural world, it becomes the agricultural fertility cycle. When it is projected onto cosmogony, it becomes the world-from-a-body myth.

### 5.3 Entheogens and Ego Death

K17 documents the role of psychoactive substances (entheogens) in shamanic practice and religious experience. A consistent feature of high-dose psychedelic experiences — with psilocybin, ayahuasca (DMT + MAO inhibitor), ibogaine, mescaline, 5-MeO-DMT — is **ego death** (also called "ego dissolution" or "psychedelic death"):

- The sense of individual selfhood dissolves
- Boundaries between self and world collapse
- The experiencer feels they have "died"
- A period of cosmic unity or formlessness
- Gradual reconstitution of the self, often with a profound sense of rebirth

Roland Griffiths et al. at Johns Hopkins University (2006, *Journal of Psychopharmacology*) found that 67% of participants rated a psilocybin experience as among the five most meaningful experiences of their lives, and the experience frequently involved "death and rebirth" themes.

### 5.4 The Filter Model Connection

K12 (Brain as Filter vs. Generator) explores the hypothesis — articulated by William James (*Human Immortality*, 1898), Aldous Huxley (*The Doors of Perception*, 1954), and more recently by Bernardo Kastrup (*Why Materialism Is Baloney*, 2014) — that the brain acts as a **filter** or **reducing valve** for consciousness rather than generating it.

Under this model:
- Normal waking consciousness = heavily filtered
- Shamanic trance / psychedelic experience / near-death experience = temporary reduction of the filter
- Death = permanent removal of the filter
- Resurrection / return from death = reactivation of the filter with expanded settings (the shaman returns with abilities they didn't have before)

The dying-and-rising deity, on this reading, enacts the **cosmic version** of what the shaman experiences personally: the death of the limited self (the filter) and the rebirth of expanded consciousness (the filter recalibrated). This is speculative but connects the mythological pattern to the consciousness research documented in Section K.

## 6. CRITICAL ANALYSIS

### 6.1 Smith's Valid Critique

Jonathan Z. Smith was correct that **lumping all these examples together obscures important differences.** The dying-and-rising pattern is not monolithic:

- **Osiris** does not return to the living world — he rules the dead
- **Dumuzi/Tammuz** returns only half the year — a seasonal rotation
- **Baal** genuinely dies and returns — the strongest case
- **Attis** may not have had a resurrection in the earliest traditions
- **Adonis** is mourned but his "return" is ritualized, not narratively explicit
- **Baldr** will return — but only after the apocalypse (a future promise, not a past event)
- **Purusha, Pangu, Ymir** do not "rise" at all — their death IS creation
- **Quetzalcoatl** transforms (into Venus) rather than returning in the same form
- **Christ** claims bodily resurrection — unique specificity

These are genuine differences. A responsible analysis must acknowledge them.

### 6.2 The Agricultural Interpretation

Frazer's vegetation-cycle interpretation works for:
- ✅ Dumuzi/Tammuz (six months below / six months above = seasonal)
- ✅ Adonis (Gardens of Adonis = plant growth and withering)
- ✅ Attis (spring festival = vegetation rebirth)
- ✅ Baal (Mot treated as grain — winnowed, ground, scattered)

But fails for:
- ❌ Osiris (not a vegetation deity; permanent underworld ruler)
- ❌ Purusha (cosmogonic sacrifice; no seasonal element)
- ❌ Pangu (cosmogonic; no return)
- ❌ Ymir (cosmogonic; killed once)
- ❌ Quetzalcoatl (astronomical — Venus cycle, not agricultural)
- ❌ Christ (historical claim, not seasonal ritual)

The agricultural interpretation captures at most half the cases. A broader framework is needed.

### 6.3 The Transformation Interpretation

A more universal reading: **death-and-rebirth = transformation of state.** The deity does not merely return to the same condition — they return *changed* (or their death changes everything):

- Osiris: from living king → to underworld lord (transformation of domain)
- Dumuzi: from carefree shepherd → to underworld shadow / seasonal cycle (transformation into pattern)
- Baal: from contested king → to established king who has defeated Death itself (transformation by ordeal)
- Zagreus/Dionysus: from one form → reborn in another (transformation of identity)
- Quetzalcoatl: from human priest-king → to Morning Star (transformation of substance)
- Purusha: from primordial being → to the cosmos itself (transformation of scale)
- Shaman: from ordinary person → to healer with spirit-world access (transformation of capacity)

Transformation, not mere revival, is the common thread.

### 6.4 Why This Matters for the Project

If the dying-and-rising/dying-and-transforming pattern is real (which the evidence strongly supports, pace Smith's objections), then it connects **every section** of the project:

- **Section A (Foundation Texts)**: the foundation texts describe these beings and their sacrifices (Pyramid Texts → Osiris; Sumerian literary texts → Dumuzi; Ugaritic tablets → Baal; Rigveda → Purusha)
- **Section B (Beings and Entities)**: the knowledge-giving beings of B01–B10 sacrifice themselves or suffer for their gifts to humanity
- **Section C (Global Traditions)**: C18 (Prometheus/Forbidden Knowledge) establishes that the giver suffers; C28 (this document) establishes that the suffering includes death and transformation
- **Section E (Cataclysms and Chronology)**: E12 (Cyclical Destruction) and E14 (World Ages/Kali Yuga) are the COSMIC scale of the death-rebirth pattern — the world itself dies and is reborn
- **Section K (Consciousness)**: K12, K15, K17 — the personal/experiential version of the pattern is the altered state / initiatory death / ego death that shamans and psychonauts undergo

The pattern thus operates on three scales:
1. **Personal** — shamanic initiation, ego death, near-death experience
2. **Mythological** — the dying-and-rising deity
3. **Cosmological** — cyclical destruction and recreation of the world

Whether these three scales are really ONE phenomenon seen from different angles — or three independently generated patterns — is the central question.

## SOURCE NOTES & RELIABILITY ASSESSMENT

### Source Analysis

The textual evidence for the dying-and-rising deity pattern is among the most extensively documented in all of comparative mythology and religious studies:

**Primary Ancient Sources:**
- **Pyramid Texts** (~2400–2300 BCE): the oldest religious texts in the world, containing Osiris's death and "resurrection" as underworld lord. Museum collections: Saqqara pyramids, translations by R.O. Faulkner (*The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts*, 1969) and James P. Allen (*The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts*, 2005)
- **Sumerian literary compositions** (Ur III / Old Babylonian, ~2100–1600 BCE): *Inanna's Descent*, *Dumuzi's Dream*. ETCSL (Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature, University of Oxford). Translations by S.N. Kramer and Thorkild Jacobsen.
- **Ugaritic Baal Cycle** (~1400–1200 BCE): tablets from Ras Shamra. Translations by Mark S. Smith, Dennis Pardee, N. Wyatt.
- **Rigveda** (~1200–1000 BCE): *Purusha Sukta* (RV 10.90). Translations by R.T.H. Griffith (1896), Stephanie Jamison and Joel Brereton (*The Rigveda*, 2014, Oxford University Press).
- **Prose Edda** (Snorri Sturluson, ~1220 CE) and **Poetic Edda** (13th century manuscript, older oral tradition). Translations by Anthony Faulkes (1987), Carolyne Larrington (1996, Oxford World's Classics).

### Tier Classification Rationale

**Tier 1**: The textual evidence for the dying-and-rising deity pattern across cultures is extensive, well-documented, and published in critical editions with full scholarly apparatus. The ancient sources (Pyramid Texts, Sumerian compositions, Ugaritic tablets, Rigveda, Eddas) are independently attested, physically extant, and translated by multiple scholars. The cross-cultural parallels are observable and not dependent on speculative inference. The *existence* of the pattern is a fact of comparative mythology. The *explanation* for the pattern — agricultural, psychological, shamanic, diffusionist, or experiential — remains actively debated in established academic disciplines.
