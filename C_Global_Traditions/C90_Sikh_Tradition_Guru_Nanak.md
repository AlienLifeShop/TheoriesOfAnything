## QUICK SUMMARY

Sikhism, founded by Guru Nanak (1469–1539 CE) in the Punjab region, is the youngest of the world's major religions and among the most radical in its rejection of caste hierarchy, gender inequality, and empty ritual. Its central scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib (originally Adi Granth), holds the unique distinction of being a holy book elevated to the status of a living guru — a concept unparalleled in world religions. Through ten human Gurus spanning 1469–1708, Sikhism developed a distinctive theology centered on Ik Onkar (One Supreme Reality), Naam (divine name meditation), and seva (selfless service), culminating in the Khalsa warrior-saint order. The institution of langar — a free communal kitchen open to all regardless of caste, class, or creed — represents one of the most sustained experiments in radical equality in human history, currently feeding an estimated 100,000+ people daily at the Golden Temple alone.

## 1. VERIFIED CLAIMS (Tier 1 — Peer-Reviewed / Archaeological Record)

### 1.1 Historical Foundation
- Guru Nanak Dev Ji (1469–1539 CE) is a thoroughly documented historical figure born in Talwandi (now Nankana Sahib, Pakistan).
- The succession of ten Sikh Gurus from Nanak to Gobind Singh (1666–1708) is well-established through contemporary records, Sikh chronicles (Janamsakhis), and Mughal administrative documents.
- The Guru Granth Sahib was compiled by Guru Arjan (5th Guru) in 1604, with the final version completed by Guru Gobind Singh in 1706 — manuscript lineage is verified.

### 1.2 The Guru Granth Sahib
- Contains 1,430 pages (angs) in a standardized format maintained identically across all copies worldwide.
- Includes compositions by six Sikh Gurus plus 15 bhagats (saints) from Hindu, Muslim, and "untouchable" backgrounds — including Kabir, Farid, Ravidas, and Namdev.
- Written in Gurmukhi script (standardized by Guru Angad, 2nd Guru) with compositions in multiple languages including Punjabi, Hindi, Sanskrit, Persian, and regional dialects.
- The elevation of the text to "Eternal Guru" status by Guru Gobind Singh in 1708 ended the line of human gurus — making Sikhism the only major religion whose ultimate authority is a book-as-living-guru.

### 1.3 Institutional Practices
- **Langar:** The free community kitchen was institutionalized by Guru Angad and Guru Amar Das (3rd Guru), who required even Emperor Akbar to sit on the floor and eat with commoners before receiving audience.
- The Golden Temple (Harmandir Sahib) at Amritsar, completed 1604, has four entrances symbolizing openness to all four castes/directions — its langar feeds over 100,000 daily.
- **Khalsa:** Established by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699 at Baisakhi, requiring initiated Sikhs to bear the Five Ks (Kesh, Kangha, Kara, Kachera, Kirpan) as articles of faith.

### 1.4 Historical Persecution and Resilience
- Guru Arjan was executed by Mughal Emperor Jahangir (1606) — first Sikh martyr.
- Guru Tegh Bahadur (9th Guru) was beheaded by Aurangzeb (1675) for defending the religious freedom of Kashmiri Hindus — an act of self-sacrifice for another community's rights.
- Sikh martial tradition developed directly in response to Mughal persecution, transforming from pacific spiritual movement to warrior-saint tradition.

## 2. CREDIBLE CLAIMS (Tier 2 — Academic / Debated but Supported)

### 2.1 Core Theological Concepts
- **Ik Onkar** ("One Supreme Reality"): A strict monotheism that simultaneously transcends form (nirguna) while being immanent in creation (saguna) — a theological position scholars compare to both Sufi and Advaita Vedanta frameworks.
- **Naam Simran** (meditation on the divine name): The central spiritual practice, involving repetition and deep contemplation of God's names, understood as connecting individual consciousness to universal reality (→ K08).
- **Hukam** (divine order): The concept that all existence operates within a cosmic order — acceptance of hukam as the path to spiritual liberation.
- **Haumai** (ego/self-centeredness): Identified as the root obstacle to spiritual realization — structurally parallel to Buddhist attachment and Christian pride.
- **Five Thieves** (panj chor): Lust, anger, greed, attachment, pride — obstacles remarkably consistent with vice lists across traditions.

### 2.2 Revolutionary Social Dimensions
- Guru Nanak's declaration "There is no Hindu, there is no Muslim" challenged the fundamental religious-social categories of 15th-century South Asia.
- The Sikh rejection of caste was not merely theoretical: the institution of langar, the inclusion of "untouchable" saints in scripture, and the adoption of common surname (Singh/Kaur) were concrete structural challenges to hierarchy.
- Women's equality was explicitly affirmed: "Why call her bad from whom kings are born?" (Guru Nanak, Asa di Var) — women could lead worship, participate in all ceremonies, and serve in the Khalsa.
- The Khalsa identity (common surname, distinctive appearance) functioned as a deliberate erasure of caste markers — making it impossible to identify caste from name or appearance.

### 2.3 Musical and Aesthetic Tradition
- The Guru Granth Sahib is organized by raag (musical mode) — 31 raags structure the entire text, making it both scripture and the world's largest musical composition.
- Kirtan (devotional singing) is the primary mode of worship — the text is meant to be sung, not merely read.
- This music-as-theology approach parallels but exceeds similar traditions in Sufism, Bhakti Hinduism, and early Christian psalmody.

### 2.4 Guru Nanak's Travels (Udasis)
- Traditional accounts describe four great journeys (udasis) by Guru Nanak covering much of South Asia, Tibet, the Middle East (including Mecca and Baghdad), and possibly further.
- While the full geographical extent is debated, evidence from Janamsakhis and local traditions across multiple regions supports extensive travel and inter-religious dialogue.
- Nanak's encounters with Sufi, Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain practitioners reflect a deliberate comparative-religion methodology rare for the period.

## 3. SPECULATIVE CLAIMS (Tier 3 — Possible but Unverified)

### 3.1 Syncretic Origins Debate
- The "Sikhism as synthesis of Hinduism and Islam" thesis (common in colonial-era scholarship) has been largely rejected by contemporary scholars (McLeod, Mandair, Singh) who argue Sikhism represents an independent revelation, though one deeply engaged in dialogue with both traditions.
- Nanak's theological vocabulary draws from both Islamic (Khuda, Rahim) and Hindu (Ram, Hari) traditions, but reconfigures them within a distinctive framework — whether this constitutes synthesis, transcendence, or independent insight remains debated.

### 3.2 Mystical Experience
- Guru Nanak's three-day disappearance in the Vein River (c. 1499) — after which he emerged with the foundational revelation "There is no Hindu, there is no Muslim" — is described in Sikh tradition as direct communion with the Divine Court (Sachkhand).
- The phenomenology of this experience (immersion, absence, return with transformative knowledge) parallels initiatory experiences across shamanic, prophetic, and mystical traditions worldwide (→ K15).

### 3.3 Perennial Philosophy Connection
- The Sikh concept of Ik Onkar's simultaneous transcendence and immanence maps closely onto the perennial philosophy's conception of the Absolute (→ P10).
- Guru Nanak's insistence on direct experience over scriptural authority and ritual echoes similar emphases in Zen Buddhism, Sufism, and Christian mysticism — suggesting either common source, common structure of mystical experience, or both.

## 4. DUBIOUS CLAIMS (Tier 4 — No Credible Source)

### 4.1 Unsupported Assertions
- Claims that Guru Nanak physically traveled to supernatural realms rather than experiencing mystical states lack scholarly support and misread Sikh theological language.
- Pseudohistorical assertions that Sikhism was "secretly" derived from a single other tradition (whether Islam, Hinduism, or esoteric movements) contradict the textual and historical evidence.
- New Age appropriations claiming Sikhs possessed "ancient technology" encoded in the Guru Granth Sahib have no textual basis.
- Internet claims linking Sikh warrior tradition to extraterrestrial guidance have absolutely no foundation in any Sikh source.
