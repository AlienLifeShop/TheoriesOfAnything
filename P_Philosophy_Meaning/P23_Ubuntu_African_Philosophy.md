## QUICK SUMMARY

African philosophy encompasses a rich and diverse family of intellectual traditions far too often overlooked in global philosophical discourse. Ubuntu — "I am because we are" (umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu) — is the most widely recognized expression of Southern African communitarian ethics, but it represents just one strand of a continent-wide tapestry. Yoruba concepts of Ori (personal destiny) and omoluabi (person of good character), Akan Sankofa (learning from the past) and Adinkra symbolic philosophy, Bantu vital force ontology, and ancient Egyptian Maat (truth, justice, cosmic order) all constitute sophisticated philosophical systems that address fundamental questions of ethics, personhood, knowledge, and reality. The application of Ubuntu principles in South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission demonstrated the practical political power of African philosophical concepts, while ongoing scholarly work challenges the exclusion of African thought from mainstream philosophy.

## 1. VERIFIED CLAIMS (Tier 1 — Peer-Reviewed / Archaeological Record)

### 1.1 Ubuntu — Core Definition and Linguistic Basis
- **Ubuntu** (Zulu/Xhosa): derived from the Nguni Bantu proverb *umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu* — "a person is a person through other persons"
- Present in variant forms across virtually all Bantu languages (500+ languages, ~350 million speakers): *botho* (Sotho/Tswana), *hunhu* (Shona), *utu* (Swahili), *obuntu* (Luganda), *bumuntu* (Kikongo)
- **Core ethical principle:** personhood is not an innate, individual possession but is **achieved through participation in community**
- One **becomes** a person (in the full moral sense) through relationships, obligations, and ethical conduct — a newborn has biological life but must grow into full personhood
- **Not merely collectivism:** Ubuntu includes individual moral responsibility — the community enables personhood, but each person must actively cultivate it
- Comparative: distinct from Western individualism AND from East Asian collectivism — Ubuntu emphasizes **relational personhood** rather than subordination to the group

### 1.2 Maat (Ancient Egyptian) — Oldest Recorded Ethical System
- **Maat (Maʿat):** Egyptian concept of truth, justice, cosmic order, balance, reciprocity — personified as the goddess Maat (feathered headdress)
- Earliest attestation: Pyramid Texts (~2400 BCE) — possibly the **oldest ethical system on record**
- Pharaoh's primary duty: to uphold Maat — legitimate rule required maintaining cosmic and social order
- **Weighing of the Heart:** in the judgment of the dead (Book of the Dead, Spell 125), the deceased's heart is weighed against the feather of Maat — if heavier (laden with wrongdoing), devoured by Ammit
- **42 Negative Confessions:** the deceased declares before 42 assessor deities what wrongs they have NOT committed — a detailed ethical code predating the Ten Commandments by ~1,000 years
  - Includes: "I have not stolen," "I have not killed," "I have not told lies," "I have not caused weeping," "I have not polluted the water"
- Maat as cosmic principle: without Maat, the universe returns to **isfet** (chaos, injustice) — ethics is not merely human convention but cosmic necessity

### 1.3 Truth and Reconciliation Commission — Ubuntu in Practice
- **TRC (1996-1998):** established by President Nelson Mandela, chaired by Archbishop **Desmond Tutu**, to address apartheid-era crimes
- Explicitly grounded in Ubuntu philosophy: justice understood as **restorative** rather than retributive — healing relationships rather than punishing offenders
- Tutu: "Ubuntu speaks particularly about the fact that you can't exist as a human being in isolation. It speaks about our interconnectedness."
- Process: perpetrators could apply for amnesty by making **full disclosure** of politically motivated crimes — victims had the opportunity to confront perpetrators and tell their stories
- **Outcome:** ~7,000 amnesty applications; ~2,000 victims testified publicly; partial success — criticized for failing to deliver material reparations, but widely praised for preventing civil war and establishing a shared narrative
- Influenced subsequent transitional justice initiatives in Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Colombia

### 1.4 Documented African Philosophical Traditions — Academic Record
- **Professional African philosophy** began with Placide Tempels (*Bantu Philosophy*, 1945 — controversial but foundational) and Alexis Kagame (*Bantu-Rwandan Philosophy of Being*, 1956)
- **Ethnophilosophy debate:** is the reconstruction of "traditional African thought" genuine philosophy, or merely anthropology dressed in philosophical language? (Hountondji, *African Philosophy: Myth and Reality*, 1976 — argued for rigorous critical philosophy)
- **Professional/Sage philosophy:** Odera Oruka (1990) distinguished "folk sages" (who embody tradition) from "philosophic sages" (who critically reflect on tradition)
- Major 20th-21st century African philosophers: Kwasi Wiredu (Ghana), Kwame Gyekye (Ghana), Paulin Hountondji (Benin), V.Y. Mudimbe (Congo), Achille Mbembe (Cameroon), Mogobe Ramose (South Africa)

## 2. CREDIBLE CLAIMS (Tier 2 — Academic / Debated but Supported)

### 2.1 Yoruba Philosophy — Ori and Omoluabi
- **Ori (inner head/personal destiny):** Yoruba concept that each person has an Ori — a spiritual essence chosen before birth that determines one's destiny
  - Ori is the "personal god" — more important than any orisha (deity), because the orishas cannot help someone whose Ori has not granted consent
  - "If your Ori does not approve, the gods cannot help" — Yoruba proverb
- **Omoluabi:** "child of the lord of good character" — the Yoruba ideal person
  - Qualities: ìwà (good character, the paramount value), ọ̀rọ̀ (respect), sùúrù (patience), inú rere (good intentions), àkínkanjú (bravery), ọtítọ́ (truth)
- **Ifa divination system:** a vast corpus of oral literature (256 odù) encoding Yoruba philosophy, ethics, history, and practical wisdom — recognized by UNESCO as Intangible Cultural Heritage (2005)

### 2.2 Akan Philosophy — Sankofa and Adinkra
- **Sankofa (San-KO-fa):** Akan concept meaning "go back and get it" (from *san* = return, *ko* = go, *fa* = take)
  - Symbolized by a bird turning backward to retrieve an egg from its back — learning from the past to move forward
  - Widely adopted symbol in African diaspora education and cultural movements
- **Adinkra symbols:** Akan visual philosophical symbols (~80+ known), each encoding a concept:
  - *Gye Nyame* ("except God") — omnipotence of God
  - *Dwennimmen* (ram's horns) — humility with strength
  - *Funtunfunefu-Denkyemfunefu* (conjoined crocodiles sharing one stomach) — unity in diversity, shared destiny
- **Akan metaphysics (Gyekye, 1987):** categories include *sunsum* (spirit), *okra* (soul), *mogya* (blood/clan identity) — sophisticated ontology of personhood
- **Akan communalism:** individual rights exist but are balanced by communal obligations — Gyekye argues for "moderate communitarianism" (neither radical individualism nor radical collectivism)

### 2.3 Bantu Vital Force Ontology
- **Tempels (1945):** proposed that the fundamental category of Bantu philosophy is **vital force** (*force vitale*) — not "being" (as in Western ontology) but dynamic, living energy (→ C40)
- Hierarchy of forces: God (supreme force) → founding ancestors → living elders → living adults → animals → plants → minerals
- **Interaction of forces:** beings can strengthen or weaken the vital force of others — ethics is about maintaining and enhancing the vital force of the community
- **Criticism:** Hountondji argued Tempels imposed European philosophical categories onto Bantu thought; Kagame's Kinyarwanda-based analysis offered a linguistically grounded alternative
- **Nevertheless:** the concept of vital force (under various local names) appears across Bantu-speaking cultures — *ntu* (being/force), *umoya* (breath/spirit in Zulu), *moyo* (life force in Swahili)

### 2.4 African Conceptions of Time
- **John Mbiti** (*African Religions and Philosophy*, 1969): proposed that traditional African time perception is heavily oriented toward the **past and present** (Sasa = lived time; Zamani = deep past/mythic time) — with less emphasis on the distant future
- **Controversial:** criticized as overgeneralized (700+ ethnic groups cannot share a single time concept) and potentially primitivizing
- However: emphasis on ancestral connection and cyclical time patterns (seasons, agricultural cycles, generational rhythms) is widely documented across African ontologies
- Contrast with linear Western teleological time — implications for understanding African narrative structures and historical consciousness

## 3. SPECULATIVE CLAIMS (Tier 3 — Possible but Unverified)

### 3.1 Maat as Foundation of Greek Philosophy
- Claim: Greek philosophy (particularly Pythagorean and Platonic traditions) was significantly influenced by Egyptian Maat through contact at centers like Heliopolis
- **Evidence for contact:** Greek philosophers (Thales, Pythagoras, Plato) reportedly traveled to Egypt — ancient sources attest this, though details are legendary
- **Martin Bernal** (*Black Athena*, 1987): argued for substantial Egyptian/Phoenician influence on Greek civilization — highly controversial
- **Scholarly consensus:** some influence is probable (mathematics, geometry, astronomy), but the extent is debated; direct philosophical transmission is harder to establish
- The 42 Negative Confessions and Greek virtue ethics share structural parallels — but independent development is also plausible

### 3.2 Ubuntu as Global Ethical Framework
- Proposal (Ramose, 1999; Metz, 2007): Ubuntu could serve as a foundation for global ethics and human rights — an alternative to Western liberal individualism
- **Strengths:** emphasizes community, ecological responsibility, restorative justice, human interconnectedness
- **Challenges:** how does Ubuntu handle radical disagreement? Individual rights against community consensus? Gender equality within patriarchal community structures?
- Some scholars (Matolino & Kwindingwi, 2013) argue Ubuntu has been "overused and misappropriated" — reduced to a slogan rather than engaged as a rigorous philosophical tradition

### 3.3 Pre-Colonial African Science and Technology
- Evidence for sophisticated pre-colonial African knowledge systems: Dogon astronomical knowledge (debated), Yoruba mathematical systems (base-20), Great Zimbabwe engineering, Ethiopian architecture (Lalibela)
- These achievements suggest philosophical sophistication beyond what colonial narratives acknowledged
- Challenge: much pre-colonial African philosophy was oral, and colonial destruction of knowledge systems makes reconstruction difficult (→ H12)

## 4. DUBIOUS CLAIMS (Tier 4 — No Credible Source)

### 4.1 Africa as Source of ALL Philosophy
- Extreme Afrocentric claim: all world philosophy originates in Africa — Greece, India, and China merely borrowed
- While African philosophy is ancient and sophisticated, independent philosophical traditions clearly developed across multiple civilizations
- This claim unintentionally mirrors the Eurocentrism it seeks to counter — by making Africa the single center

### 4.2 Ubuntu Means "No Individual Rights"
- Misrepresentation (sometimes by authoritarian regimes): Ubuntu = conformity, suppression of individual dissent
- Tutu, Ramose, and other Ubuntu philosophers explicitly reject this: Ubuntu affirms individual dignity THROUGH community, not against it
- Apartheid itself was the antithesis of Ubuntu — its abolition was an expression of Ubuntu principles

### 4.3 African Thought Is "Pre-Philosophical"
- Colonial-era claim (Lévy-Bruhl, *How Natives Think*, 1910): "primitive" peoples have "pre-logical" mentality — incapable of abstract philosophical thought
- Thoroughly debunked: Kagame's linguistic analysis, Wiredu's conceptual analysis, and Oruka's sage philosophy demonstrate rigorous abstract thought within African traditions
- The claim itself reflects epistemic injustice (Fricker) — denying philosophical status to non-Western traditions based on prejudice, not evidence (→ P19)
