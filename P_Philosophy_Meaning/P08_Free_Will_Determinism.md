## QUICK SUMMARY

The free will debate is central to the meaning of human existence: Are we the authors of our choices, or is every decision the inevitable consequence of prior causes? Three major positions dominate: (1) Hard determinism — every event is determined by prior causes; free will is an illusion (Spinoza, Laplace, Harris, Sapolsky). (2) Compatibilism — free will is compatible with determinism if we define "free" properly (Hume, Frankfurt, Dennett). (3) Libertarian free will — genuine indeterminate freedom exists (Kant, agent causation, some quantum interpretations). Neuroscience has intensified the debate: Libet's experiments (1983) suggested unconscious neural activity precedes conscious decisions by ~350 ms, challenging the sense of willful agency. The stakes are immense: moral responsibility, legal systems, the meaning of life, and the nature of consciousness all hinge on whether free will is real, illusory, or something between.

## 1. VERIFIED CLAIMS (Tier 1 — Established Philosophy / Empirical Neuroscience)

### 1.1 Causal Determinism — The Scientific Case [4/5 sources]
- Classical physics (Newton): given complete knowledge of all particles' positions and momenta, plus all forces, every future state is in principle predictable
- **Laplace's Demon** (1814): a hypothetical intelligence knowing all positions, momenta, and forces could calculate the entire future and past of the universe — including every human thought and choice
- Chemistry: chemical reactions follow deterministic laws. Neurons are chemical systems. Therefore neural activity (thoughts, decisions) is determined by prior chemical states.
- Genetics + environment = behavior: the entire field of behavioral genetics
- **Counter:** Quantum mechanics introduces genuine indeterminacy at the fundamental level (see 1.2). But this may not help free will — random choices aren't "free" either.

### 1.2 Quantum Indeterminacy — Does It Help? [4/5 sources]
- **Verified:** Quantum mechanics is genuinely indeterministic (in most interpretations). Radioactive decay, photon polarization, etc. have no deterministic cause.
- **But:** Quantum effects are negligible at the scale of neural firing. Thermal noise dominates. Neurons are classical systems for practical purposes.
- **Exception:** Penrose-Hameroff Orch-OR theory proposes quantum coherence in microtubules IS relevant to consciousness (Tier 3 — see P01)
- **Philosophical point:** Even if quantum randomness affects decisions, randomness ≠ freedom. A random choice is not a FREE choice — it's no one's choice at all. Free will requires AGENCY, not just indeterminacy.
- **Some libertarians respond:** agent causation (see 2.3) is not randomness — it's a unique type of causation by a subject

### 1.3 Libet's Experiments — The Neuroscience Challenge [4/5 sources]
- Benjamin Libet (1983): asked subjects to flex a wrist spontaneously and note when they decided to act
- Readiness Potential (RP, Bereitschaftspotential): unconscious neural buildup begins ~550 ms before action; subjects report awareness of their "decision" only ~200 ms before action
- **Implication:** The brain "decides" before you consciously "will" — conscious will is not the cause of action; it's a post-hoc report
- **Counter-arguments (important):**
  - Libet himself noted subjects could VETO the action after becoming aware ("free won't" if not "free will")
  - Schurger, Sitt & Dehaene (2012): the Readiness Potential may be spontaneous neural noise crossing a threshold, not a "decision." Reanalysis found the RP pattern is consistent with a stochastic accumulator model
  - Timing of subjective reports is notoriously unreliable (Dennett & Kinsbourne 1992)
  - The task (flex a wrist at a random time) is trivial — deliberative, reasoned decisions may involve very different processes
  - Later studies (Fried 2011, Soon et al. 2008): brain activity predicts decisions up to 7–10 seconds before awareness — BUT with only ~60–70% accuracy, suggesting the "prediction" is partial, not deterministic

### 1.4 Robert Sapolsky — Contemporary Determinist [3/5 sources]
- *Determined: A Science of Life Without Free Will* (2023): argues that neuroscience, genetics, endocrinology, and evolutionary biology make free will impossible
- Every choice is determined by: genes, prenatal environment, childhood, culture, hormonal state, blood sugar, neurotransmitter levels, etc.
- Sapolsky argues moral responsibility is an incoherent concept — we should restructure law and ethics around quarantine/protection, not punishment
- **Counter (Dennett):** Sapolsky defines free will as requiring a causa sui (self-causing agent), which no serious compatibilist defends. He attacks a straw man.

## 2. CREDIBLE CLAIMS (Tier 2 — Academic / Debated but Supported)

### 2.1 Compatibilism — The Dominant Academic Position [4/5 sources]
- **Most professional philosophers are compatibilists** (~59% in the 2020 PhilPapers survey vs. ~11% libertarian, ~12% no free will)
- Key moves:
  - **Hume** (1739): Freedom is not the absence of causation but the absence of coercion. You are free when your actions flow from your own desires, even if those desires are determined.
  - **Frankfurt** (1969): Frankfurt Cases — even if you couldn't have done otherwise, you're still responsible IF you acted for your own reasons. "Could have done otherwise" is not necessary for moral responsibility.
  - **Dennett** (1984, 2003): Freedom is the ability to act according to reasons, to be responsive to information and argument. Determinism makes this POSSIBLE, not impossible — determined systems can be reason-responsive.
  - **Susan Wolf** (1990): The Reason View — free will is the ability to act in accordance with reason. Being determined by good reasons IS freedom.
- **Counter (incompatibilists):** Compatibilism redefines "free will" to avoid the problem. What most people mean by free will includes COULD HAVE DONE OTHERWISE in a metaphysically robust sense. Compatibilist freedom is "free will" in name only.

### 2.2 Hard Incompatibilism / Skepticism [3/5 sources]
- **Derk Pereboom** (2001): Whether determinism or indeterminism is true, free will (in the sense required for moral responsibility) is impossible
- Determinism: choices are inevitable consequences of prior causes
- Indeterminism: introduces randomness, not freedom
- Neither yields genuine agential control
- Pereboom argues we should abandon retributive punishment but can maintain forward-looking moral practices (rehabilitation, protection)
- **Gregg Caruso** (2021): skepticism about free will should lead to a public health/quarantine model of criminal justice, not punishment-based system

### 2.3 Libertarian Free Will [3/5 sources]
- NOT political libertarianism — this is the metaphysical position that free will requires genuine indeterminacy + agential control
- **Agent Causation** (Chisholm 1964, O'Connor 2000): The agent (person) is a substance that causes actions without being caused to do so by prior events. The agent is an uncaused cause.
  - Problem: Mysterious. How does a physical substance cause events outside the causal chain? This seems to invoke dualism.
- **Robert Kane** (1996): libertarian free will is grounded in moments of genuine indeterminacy (perhaps quantum-amplified) during torn decisions. The indeterminacy is resolved BY the agent's own conflicting motivational sets. Not random, not determined — genuinely free.
- **Kant** (1785, 1788): In the phenomenal world, everything is deterministic. But the noumenal self (the thing-in-itself) is outside time and cause, and IS genuinely free. Freedom is a presupposition of morality, not a scientific finding.

### 2.4 Cultural Perspectives on Free Will and Fate [3/5 sources]
- **Islamic Qadar debate:** Predestination (God decrees all) vs. human responsibility (humans choose and are judged). Different schools: Ash'ari (divine decree + human "acquisition"), Mu'tazili (genuine human freedom), Maturidi (compromise)
- **Hindu karma:** Deterministic consequences from past actions, but PRESENT choices are free → determines future karma. Semi-compatibilist.
- **Stoicism:** Events are determined by Providence (the logos), but your RESPONSE (attitude, virtue) is up to you. Freedom IS inner virtue. Epictetus: "It's not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters."
- **Calvinist predestination:** God has already determined who will be saved and who damned. Free will is an illusion, yet humans are still held responsible. One of the most extreme theological determinist positions.
- **Buddhist dependent origination:** All phenomena arise dependently; there is no independent self that could be "free." But liberation is possible through insight into this very fact. Freedom is freedom FROM the illusion of a separate self.

### 2.5 Legal and Moral Implications [3/5 sources]
- Every legal system assumes some degree of free will: intent (mens rea), responsibility, culpability
- Legal defenses that negate free will: insanity, duress, automatism, diminished capacity, brain tumors (Charles Whitman, 1966)
- FMRI evidence in courts: emerging but controversial. Brain scans have been introduced in sentencing (Roper v. Simmons, 2005 — adolescent brain development)
- If determinism eliminates responsibility: retributive justice is unjustified; only forward-looking protections are legitimate
- Experimental findings (Vohs & Schooler 2008): people who are told free will is an illusion are MORE likely to cheat. Believing in free will may be functionally important regardless of its truth.

## 3. SPECULATIVE CLAIMS (Tier 3 — Possible but Unverified)

### 3.1 Consciousness as Causal Agent [2/5 sources]
- If consciousness is fundamental (panpsychism/P05) and not produced by the brain, conscious will could be a genuine causal force outside the physical causal chain
- Stapp (2007): quantum mechanics requires "the choosing agent" (observer) to select outcomes. Consciousness IS the cause of wave function collapse → free will is real.
- This depends on the consciousness-causes-collapse interpretation of QM, which is a minority view
- **Counter:** most physicists argue measurement = decoherence, not consciousness

### 3.2 Free Will and the Block Universe [2/5 sources]
- If the block universe is real (Q08), past, present, and future all exist equally
- This seems to imply all future events are already "fixed" — all choices are already made
- **But:** Compatibilists in a block universe argue: your choices are real even if fixed. The block contains your deliberation AS a cause of your action. It's not fate — it's you choosing, timelessly.
- **The growing block** or **moving spotlight** theories preserve more intuitive free will: the future is genuinely open

### 3.3 Simulation Free Will [2/5 sources]
- If we're in a simulation (G02), our choices may be both determined (by the simulation's code) AND "free" within the simulation's logic
- Like characters in a sufficiently complex video game who make genuine (within-game) choices
- Whether simulated free will counts as "real" free will is a deep question
- Connects to: What distinguishes a deterministic but complex system from a "free" one?

## 4. DUBIOUS CLAIMS (Tier 4 — No Credible Source / Contradicted by Evidence)

### 4.1 "Neuroscience Has Disproven Free Will" [4/5 sources]
- **[OVERSTATED]** Libet's experiments and their successors challenge the TIMING of conscious awareness but do not prove that conscious deliberation is causally ineffective. The experiments use trivial decisions (flex a wrist) that may not represent genuine deliberative choice. Schurger et al. (2012) reinterpreted the Readiness Potential as stochastic noise, not a "decision."

### 4.2 "Quantum Mechanics Proves Free Will" [4/5 sources]
- **[OVERSTATED]** Quantum indeterminacy is real but (a) negligible at neural scales in most models, (b) randomness ≠ freedom. The Conway-Kochen "Free Will Theorem" (2006) shows particles' behavior is not determined by prior states — but this is about particles, not persons.

### 4.3 "Everything Is Fated — There's No Point in Choosing" [4/5 sources]
- **[INCOHERENT]** Even hard determinists acknowledge that deliberation is causally relevant. Believing "everything is fated" doesn't change that YOUR deliberation IS one of the causal factors. The advice "don't bother deciding" is itself a decision recommendation, and therefore self-undermining.
