## QUICK SUMMARY

Approximately 95% of the universe's total mass-energy content is invisible: ~27% dark matter and ~68% dark energy. Dark matter was first inferred by Fritz Zwicky (1933) from galaxy cluster dynamics and confirmed by Vera Rubin's galaxy rotation curves (1970s). It clumps, bends light, and shaped the cosmic web of galaxies — yet no particle has ever been detected. Dark energy was discovered in 1998 when two teams (Riess/Perlmutter/Schmidt — Nobel 2011) found the universe's expansion is accelerating. Its nature is completely unknown: the simplest explanation (vacuum energy / cosmological constant) yields a theoretical prediction off by 10¹²⁰ — the worst prediction in physics history. Together, these mysteries represent the most profound gaps in our understanding of reality and connect deeply to questions about the universe's origin, fate, and fundamental structure.

## 1. VERIFIED CLAIMS (Tier 1 — Peer-Reviewed / Established Physics)

### 1.1 Dark Matter Evidence — Multiple Independent Lines [5/5 sources]
- **Galaxy rotation curves** (Rubin & Ford 1970, 1980): spiral galaxies rotate far too fast at their edges — visible matter alone can't hold them together. Flat rotation curves require ~10× more mass than visible
- **Galaxy cluster dynamics** (Zwicky 1933): galaxies in the Coma Cluster move too fast for the visible mass. He coined "dunkle Materie" (dark matter)
- **Gravitational lensing** (1990s–present): mass bends light (Einstein 1915). Observed lensing requires much more mass than visible. The Bullet Cluster (2006) is the "smoking gun" — two colliding clusters where visible matter (gas) was stripped away but gravitational lensing shows mass centered on the galaxies, not the gas
- **Cosmic Microwave Background** (WMAP, Planck): acoustic peaks in the CMB power spectrum precisely constrain dark matter to ~27% of total mass-energy. This is independent of all other methods and agrees
- **Big Bang Nucleosynthesis** (BBN): the abundances of light elements (H, He, Li, D) constrain baryonic matter to ~5% — independently confirming most matter is non-baryonic
- **Large-scale structure**: computer simulations of cosmic structure formation (Millennium Simulation, IllustrisTNG) reproduce the observed cosmic web ONLY with dark matter included
- **Agreement:** All six independent methods converge on ~27% dark matter. This cross-validation is extremely strong.

### 1.2 Dark Matter Is NOT Normal Matter [5/5 sources]
- Must be non-baryonic (not protons, neutrons, electrons)
- Must be "cold" (non-relativistic at the time of structure formation) — "hot" dark matter (neutrinos) can't produce the observed structure
- Must be "collisionless" (Bullet Cluster: dark matter passed through itself while gas collided)
- Must be electrically neutral (doesn't emit, absorb, or reflect light)
- Must be stable (has persisted for 13.8 billion years)
- Neutrinos were ruled out as the primary component — too fast, too light, wrong structure formation pattern

### 1.3 Cosmic Acceleration / Dark Energy Discovery [5/5 sources]
- 1998: Supernova Cosmology Project (Perlmutter) and High-z Supernova Search Team (Riess, Schmidt) independently discovered that Type Ia supernovae at high redshift are dimmer than expected — the expansion of the universe is ACCELERATING
- Nobel Prize in Physics, 2011
- Confirmed by: CMB (Planck), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BOSS, DESI), weak lensing surveys (DES)
- Dark energy constitutes ~68% of total mass-energy today
- Equation of state: w ≈ −1 (consistent with cosmological constant Λ to within ~2–3%)
- DESI preliminary results (2024): hint that w may not be exactly −1, possibly evolving over time — would rule out pure cosmological constant. Statistical significance still debated.

### 1.4 The Cosmological Constant Problem [4/5 sources]
- Einstein introduced Λ (cosmological constant) in 1917 to create a static universe; abandoned it after Hubble's expansion discovery
- Quantum field theory predicts the vacuum should contain enormous energy density (~10¹¹² erg/cm³)
- The observed value of dark energy is ~10⁻⁸ erg/cm³
- Discrepancy: **10¹²⁰** — often called "the worst prediction in the history of physics"
- Weinberg (1987) predicted the approximate observed value using anthropic reasoning BEFORE its discovery — one of the strongest arguments for the multiverse
- No known solution exists. Supersymmetry would reduce but not eliminate the problem.

## 2. CREDIBLE CLAIMS (Tier 2 — Academic / Debated but Supported)

### 2.1 WIMP Paradigm — The Leading Candidate (Under Pressure) [4/5 sources]
- WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles): hypothetical particles with mass ~10–1000 GeV, weak-force interactions
- "WIMP miracle": particles at the electroweak scale naturally produce the observed dark matter abundance through thermal freeze-out
- Direct detection experiments: LUX (2013), XENON1T (2018), XENONnT (2023), LZ (2023), PandaX-4T (2024)
- **No detection** despite reaching extraordinary sensitivity (cross-sections below 10⁻⁴⁷ cm²)
- LHC has NOT found supersymmetric particles that would be WIMP candidates
- WIMPs are not ruled out (the parameter space is large), but the "classic" WIMP is increasingly constrained
- Some physicists argue we are entering the "WIMP winter"

### 2.2 Axion Dark Matter [4/5 sources]
- Originally proposed (Peccei & Quinn 1977; Weinberg 1978; Wilczek 1978) to solve the "strong CP problem" in QCD — NOT as dark matter
- Coincidentally, axions have the right properties to BE dark matter: stable, cold, non-baryonic, abundant
- Very light (~10⁻⁶ to 10⁻³ eV) but produced non-thermally (cold despite low mass)
- Experiments: ADMX (Axion Dark Matter eXperiment) — world leader, using microwave cavities
- ADMX has begun probing the theoretically favored mass range (2018–present)
- ABRACADABRA, CASPEr, IAXO (proposed) expanding the search
- Xenon1T (2020) reported a small excess that could be consistent with solar axions — not yet confirmed

### 2.3 MOND — Modified Newtonian Dynamics [3/5 sources]
- Milgrom (1983): instead of dark matter, modify Newton's second law at very low accelerations (a < a₀ ≈ 1.2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m/s²)
- Remarkably successful at predicting galaxy rotation curves — often better than dark matter models
- The Radial Acceleration Relation (McGaugh et al. 2016): tight empirical correlation between observed and baryonic acceleration in 153 galaxies — exactly what MOND predicts, unexplained by standard ΛCDM
- **Problems with MOND:** Cannot explain the Bullet Cluster, CMB power spectrum, or large-scale structure without additional dark matter-like substance
- Relativistic extension: TeVeS (Bekenstein 2004) — partially addresses these but has theoretical problems
- Verlinde's emergent gravity (2016) reproduces MOND-like behavior from holographic principles
- **Status:** Minority position but scientifically legitimate. The RAR is a genuine puzzle that ΛCDM must explain.

### 2.4 The Hubble Tension [4/5 sources]
- Local measurements (Cepheids + Type Ia supernovae, Riess et al.): H₀ ≈ 73 km/s/Mpc
- CMB-based measurements (Planck 2018): H₀ ≈ 67.4 km/s/Mpc
- Discrepancy: ~5σ significance — unlikely to be statistical fluctuation
- Could indicate new physics beyond ΛCDM: early dark energy, new particles, modified gravity, or dark matter interactions
- JWST (2023–2024) confirmed the Cepheid distance ladder, making systematic errors less likely
- James Webb data from the SH0ES team (2024) reaffirmed H₀ ≈ 73
- **This is an active crisis in cosmology** — resolution would likely reveal new physics

### 2.5 Dark Matter Self-Interaction and Small-Scale Crises [3/5 sources]
- ΛCDM has problems at galaxy scales: "cusp-core," "too-big-to-fail," "missing satellites"
- Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM, Spergel & Steinhardt 2000): DM particles scatter off each other, smoothing cusps
- SIDM fits dwarf galaxy observations better than collisionless cold dark matter
- Ultra-light/fuzzy dark matter (m ~ 10⁻²² eV) also resolves small-scale issues via quantum pressure
- These aren't alternatives to dark matter — they're modifications to its properties

## 3. SPECULATIVE CLAIMS (Tier 3 — Possible but Unverified)

### 3.1 Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter [2/5 sources]
- Zel'dovich & Novikov (1966), Hawking (1971): black holes formed in the early universe before star formation
- Could be dark matter if in the right mass range (~10¹⁷–10²³ g or ~10–100 M☉)
- LIGO/Virgo detections of unexpectedly massive black hole mergers (2015–present) revived interest
- Microlensing surveys: MACHO, EROS, Subaru/HSC have constrained but not ruled out multiple mass ranges
- **Status:** Limited to at most 10–20% of dark matter in most mass ranges. Cannot be the ENTIRE explanation.

### 3.2 Dark Matter – Dark Energy Unification [2/5 sources]
- "Unified dark sector" models: Chaplygin gas, superfluid dark matter, etc.
- The coincidence problem: why are dark matter and dark energy densities comparable NOW?
- In general, Ω_DE/Ω_DM ≈ 2.3 today; this ratio was very different in the past and will be very different in the future. We happen to observe at the transition epoch.
- Some models propose a single dark fluid that behaves like matter at small scales and dark energy at large scales
- **Status:** Theoretically intriguing but no clear observational preference over ΛCDM + fine-tuning

### 3.3 Dark Energy and the Fate of the Universe [3/5 sources]
- If w = −1 (cosmological constant): expansion accelerates forever; "heat death" in ~10¹⁰⁰ years
- If w < −1 ("phantom energy"): "Big Rip" — at a finite time in the future, expansion becomes so violent it tears apart galaxies, stars, atoms, and even spacetime itself (Caldwell et al. 2003). Estimated ~22 billion years from now for w ≈ −1.5.
- If w > −1 and evolving: dark energy could decay, possibly triggering vacuum decay (catastrophic phase transition)
- Quintessence: dark energy as a dynamical scalar field that evolves over cosmic time
- DESI 2024 hints are consistent with evolving dark energy (w > −1 in the past, approaching −1 now)

### 3.4 Ancient and Esoteric Dark Parallels [1/5 sources]
- Hindu "Akasha" — the fifth element, invisible substrate pervading all space; sometimes compared to dark energy
- Jain "Pudgala" — invisible matter particles that fill space and interact with souls
- Aristotelian "aether" — the fifth element filling space above the lunar sphere
- Aboriginal "Dreamtime" — an invisible reality underlying the visible world
- **Caution:** These are metaphorical parallels at best. Dark matter/energy are empirically detected through gravitational effects; ancient concepts served entirely different explanatory roles.

---

## 4. DUBIOUS CLAIMS (Tier 4 — No Credible Source / Contradicted by Evidence)

### 4.1 "Dark Matter Doesn't Exist — Gravity Is Just Wrong" [4/5 sources]
- **[OVERSIMPLIFIED]** While MOND works for galaxies, it fails for clusters, the CMB, and large-scale structure. No modified gravity theory successfully replaces ALL evidence for dark matter.
- The Bullet Cluster provides near-definitive evidence that dark matter is a substance, not a modification of gravity.

### 4.2 "Dark Energy Is Free Energy We Can Harvest" [5/5 sources]
- **[DEBUNKED]** Dark energy's energy density is ~10⁻²⁹ g/cm³ — the energy in a cubic kilometer of space equals roughly one AA battery. It cannot be "tapped" or concentrated by any known or proposed mechanism.
- Thermodynamic arguments prevent extracting useful work from a uniform background.

### 4.3 "Scientists Made Up Dark Matter to Save a Failed Theory" [4/5 sources]
- **[MISLEADING]** Six independent lines of evidence converge on the same answer. This is how science works — inferring unseen entities from multiple independent observations (cf. neutrinos, atoms, black holes before 2019).
