## QUICK SUMMARY

The Phoenicians and their Carthaginian successors were the ancient world's supreme mariners, operating an extensive maritime network across the Mediterranean and beyond from roughly 1500 BCE to 146 BCE. Ancient literary sources describe remarkable voyages into the Atlantic, including Hanno's exploration of West Africa (~500 BCE), Himilco's northern voyage to the Tin Islands (~500 BCE), and a Phoenician circumnavigation of Africa commissioned by Pharaoh Necho II (~600 BCE). These accounts, combined with archaeological evidence of Phoenician navigational expertise and trade reach, raise persistent questions about how far Phoenician sailors truly ventured—and whether they could have crossed the Atlantic.

## 1. VERIFIED CLAIMS (Tier 1 — Peer-Reviewed / Archaeological Record)

### 1.1 Phoenician Maritime Supremacy
- Phoenician city-states (Tyre, Sidon, Byblos, Berytus) dominated Mediterranean maritime trade from ~1500-300 BCE.
- Archaeological evidence confirms Phoenician colonies throughout the Mediterranean: Carthage (814 BCE traditional date), Cádiz/Gadir (~1100 BCE), Lixus (Morocco), Motya (Sicily), and dozens more.
- Phoenicians invented or popularized the bireme and trireme warship designs.
- Tyrian purple dye (from *Bolinus brandaris* murex snails) was their signature luxury export.

### 1.2 Phoenician Navigation Skills
- Phoenicians navigated by Polaris (the North Star), which Greeks called the "Phoenician Star" (*Phoinikē*).
- They maintained detailed sailing guides (periploi) encoding coastal routes, harbors, distances, and landmarks.
- Night sailing capability—unusual in the ancient Mediterranean—greatly extended their range.
- Evidence of astronomical observation for navigation from multiple classical sources (Strabo, Aratus).

### 1.3 Hanno's Periplus (~500 BCE)
- Greek translation of Hanno's voyage account survives (*Periplus of Hanno*), originally inscribed in the Temple of Ba'al Hammon in Carthage.
- Describes a Carthaginian colonizing expedition with 60 penteconters and 30,000 men and women (likely exaggerated).
- Voyage went south along the West African coast from Carthage, founding colonies along the way.
- Described encountering "gorillai" — hairy wild people (possibly gorillas, chimpanzees, or a human population).
- Reached at least Senegal or Cameroon; maximum extent debated (some scholars argue Sierra Leone, others the Gulf of Guinea).

### 1.4 Archaeological Evidence at Mogador (Essaouira)
- Phoenician trading post at Mogador (modern Essaouira, Morocco) confirmed archaeologically, dating to ~7th century BCE.
- Southernmost confirmed Phoenician site on the Atlantic coast.
- Pottery, inscriptions, and murex shell remains found on Mogador island.

## 2. CREDIBLE CLAIMS (Tier 2 — Academic / Debated but Supported)

### 2.1 Necho II's Circumnavigation of Africa (~600 BCE)
- Herodotus (*Histories* IV.42) reports that Pharaoh Necho II of Egypt (~610-595 BCE) commissioned Phoenician sailors to circumnavigate Africa.
- The voyage reportedly took three years, sailing south through the Red Sea and returning through the Pillars of Hercules (Strait of Gibraltar).
- Key detail: Herodotus says the sailors reported the sun was on their right (north) when sailing west—which Herodotus disbelieved, but is exactly correct for the Southern Hemisphere.
- This incidental geographically accurate detail is often cited as evidence the account is genuine.
- Most historians consider the voyage plausible; debate centers on whether it was completed as described.

### 2.2 Himilco's Northern Voyage (~500 BCE)
- Roman sources (Pliny the Elder, Avienus) describe Himilco's voyage northward into the Atlantic (~500 BCE).
- Reportedly reached the "Oestrymnides" (Tin Islands), identified as Cornwall, Brittany, or the Scilly Isles.
- Tin trade between Cornwall and the Mediterranean is well-documented archaeologically.
- Himilco described the Sargasso Sea conditions: seaweed, calms, shallow waters, and fog.

### 2.3 Tarshish / Tartessos
- Biblical Tarshish (mentioned in Kings, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jonah) was a distant western source of silver, tin, iron, and lead.
- Most scholars identify Tarshish with Tartessos, an Iberian kingdom near modern Huelva, Spain.
- Tartessos was historically attested by Herodotus and archaeologically linked to Phoenician trade.
- The Nora Stone (Sardinia, ~9th century BCE) and other inscriptions reference westward Phoenician voyages.

### 2.4 Cádiz (Gadir) as Atlantic Gateway
- Phoenician colony of Gadir (modern Cádiz) was founded ~1100 BCE according to ancient sources, with archaeological confirmation from ~9th century BCE.
- Located beyond the Strait of Gibraltar on the Atlantic coast.
- Served as a base for Atlantic exploration and tunny fishing operations.
- Strabo describes Gadir as the launching point for voyages along both African and European Atlantic coasts.

## 3. SPECULATIVE CLAIMS (Tier 3 — Possible but Unverified)

### 3.1 Azores Amphora and Artifact Claims
- Reports of Phoenician/Roman amphorae found in the Azores archipelago (1,500 km west of Portugal).
- If confirmed, would prove ancient Atlantic voyaging to mid-ocean islands.
- Most finds lack proper archaeological context; some may be modern dumps or misidentified.
- Underwater archaeology near the Azores remains limited.

### 3.2 Phoenician Transatlantic Crossing
- Some researchers argue that Phoenician navigational capability + Atlantic current knowledge = potential for accidental or deliberate crossings.
- The Canary Current and North Equatorial Current could carry a vessel from West Africa to the Caribbean.
- No confirmed Phoenician artifacts have been found in the Americas with secure archaeological context.
- The Paraíba Inscription (Brazil, 1872): claimed Phoenician inscription—widely regarded as a 19th-century forgery, though debated by Cyrus Gordon (Brandeis University).

### 3.3 Carthaginian Secrecy Policy
- Ancient sources (Strabo, Diodorus) suggest Carthage maintained strict trade secrets, deliberately sinking foreign ships that followed their routes.
- If true, Carthaginian Atlantic discoveries may have been systematically concealed.
- The destruction of Carthage (146 BCE) would have destroyed most records of their exploration.
- This "argument from absence" is inherently unfalsifiable.

### 3.4 Diodorus Siculus and the "Great Island"
- Diodorus Siculus (*Bibliotheca Historica* V.19-20) describes Phoenicians blown off course discovering a "great island" in the Atlantic with navigable rivers.
- Some interpret this as a description of the Americas; others as Madeira, the Canaries, or pure fiction.
- Pseudo-Aristotle's *De Mirabilibus Auscultationibus* contains a similar account of Carthaginian Atlantic discovery.

## 4. DUBIOUS CLAIMS (Tier 4 — No Credible Source)

### 4.1 America's Stonehenge (Mystery Hill) as Phoenician
- Site in Salem, New Hampshire, claimed by some to be a Phoenician temple complex.
- Professional archaeological consensus: Colonial-era root cellar complex, possibly with some earlier Native American use.
- No diagnostic Phoenician artifacts recovered from controlled excavation.

### 4.2 Bat Creek Stone as Phoenician/Hebrew
- Stone found in Tennessee (1889) with inscribed characters initially claimed as Cherokee.
- Cyrus Gordon reinterpreted as Paleo-Hebrew (1st-2nd century CE).
- Mainstream consensus: probable 19th-century forgery or misidentification.

### 4.3 Systematic Phoenician Colonization of Americas
- No credible evidence for permanent Phoenician settlements in the New World.
- Occasional anomalous finds do not constitute evidence of colonization.
- Confirmation bias drives many "Phoenician in America" claims.
