## 1. MANI AND THE CREATION OF MANICHAEISM

### 1.1 Origins

**Mani** (216-274/277 CE) was born in Ctesiphon, the Mesopotamian capital of the Parthian (and later Sasanian) Empire, near modern Baghdad. This location placed him at the crossroads of the ancient world — where Zoroastrian Persia, Jewish Babylonia, early Christianity, and the eastern trade routes converged.

Mani was raised in an **Elcesaite** community — a Jewish-Christian baptismal sect that practiced ritual purification, vegetarianism (for some members), and revered the prophet Elchasai (early 2nd century CE). The Elcesaites blended Jewish Law observance with Christian messianic belief and possibly Mesopotamian astrological ideas. This environment immersed the young Mani in an already syncretic religious milieu.

### 1.2 The Visionary Experience

According to Manichaean tradition:
- At **age 12** (~228 CE): Mani received his first revelation from his "Twin" (Syriac: *taumā*) — a celestial double or divine counterpart who revealed his prophetic mission
- At **age 24** (~240 CE): the Twin appeared again, commissioning Mani to begin his public teaching

The "Twin" concept is significant — it echoes Gnostic notions of the divine spark's heavenly counterpart (A03), the Zoroastrian *fravashi* (pre-existent soul), and possibly the Buddhist concept of the bodhisattva's prior awakening.

### 1.3 The Deliberate Synthesis

Mani's genius was not accidental syncretism but **deliberate universal construction**. He explicitly identified himself as the successor of four great prophets and synthesized their teachings:

| Prophet | Tradition | What Mani Adopted |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Zoroaster** | Iranian/Persian | Cosmic dualism: Light vs. Darkness as eternal opposing principles |
| **Buddha** | Indian/Buddhist | Ethics of non-violence (*ahimsa*), vegetarianism for the elect, monastic organizational structure, transmigration of souls |
| **Jesus** | Christian/Jewish | Soteriology (salvation narrative), Jesus as a luminous savior figure, crucifixion symbolism (*Jesus patibilis* — Jesus suffering in all of nature) |
| **Mani himself** | Universal | The "Seal of the Prophets" — final revelation synthesizing all prior truth |

The claim to be the "Seal of the Prophets" (*khatam al-nabiyyin*) is particularly interesting — this title would later be applied to Muhammad in Islam (7th century CE). Whether there is a direct historical connection or independent usage remains debated.

### 1.4 Mani's Travels

- ~**240s CE**: Mani traveled to India (possibly the Kushan Empire, northwestern India/Pakistan), where he reportedly encountered Buddhist and possibly Hindu communities. The Kushan Empire was itself a crossroads — Gandharan Buddhist art shows Hellenistic, Persian, and Indian fusion
- ~**242 CE**: Returned to Persia; gained the patronage of **Sasanian King Shapur I** (~240-270 CE), who permitted Manichaean missionary activity throughout his empire
- Mani traveled extensively within the Sasanian Empire, sending missionaries east and west
- ~**274-277 CE**: Under **King Bahram I**, influenced by the powerful Zoroastrian priest **Kartir** (Kerdir), Mani was arrested, imprisoned, and died in captivity (possibly by crucifixion or in chains — accounts vary). His death became a martyrdom narrative paralleling Christ's passion

## 2. THE MANICHAEAN LIBRARY — WHAT THEY CARRIED

### 2.1 The Manichaean Canon

Mani was exceptional among religious founders in that he **personally authored his scriptures** and emphasized the importance of written transmission (contrasted with Buddha and Jesus, who left no writings). The Manichaean canon comprised seven major works:

1. **The Living Gospel** (*Evangelion Zindā*): Mani's version of the Christian Gospel, presenting Jesus as a Manichaean savior of light
2. **The Treasure of Life** (*Thesaurus Vitae*): systematic theology of the Manichaean cosmogony
3. **The Pragmateia** (*Pragmateia*): a treatise on cosmology and eschatology
4. **The Book of Mysteries** (*Kitāb al-Asrār*): polemic and doctrinal work
5. **The Book of Giants** (*Kawan ī Abārīg* in Middle Persian): adapted from 1 Enoch's Watchers narrative
6. **Letters** (*Epistolae*): pastoral letters to Manichaean communities
7. **Psalms and Prayers**: liturgical texts

Additionally, Mani produced the *Ārdahang* (or *Ertenk*) — a **picture book** illustrating Manichaean cosmology, legendary for its beauty and possibly the first illustrated religious text.

### 2.2 The Book of Giants — The Enochic Connection

The *Book of Giants* is the most significant text for this project's themes. Its transmission history demonstrates how specific mythological narratives can travel thousands of miles across linguistic and cultural boundaries:

**Source Material**: The original *Book of Giants* belongs to the Enochic literature tradition (A04). Fragments were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran (4Q203, 4Q530-532, 6Q8) in Aramaic — these are the Jewish originals (A05). The narrative tells of the Watchers (fallen angels) who descended to earth, mated with human women, and produced the Giants (*Nephilim*). The Giants cause destruction; Enoch intercedes but the Watchers and Giants are condemned.

**Manichaean Adaptation**: Mani adopted this narrative but transformed it:
- The Watchers became fallen demons of the realm of Darkness
- The Giants (named Sāhm, Narīmān, and others — Iranian hero names replacing Semitic ones) became embodiments of material entrapment
- Enoch's role was partially assumed by Mani himself — the ultimate revealer
- The cosmic drama was reframed within Manichaean dualism: the Giants' war becomes an episode in the eternal conflict between Light and Darkness

**Manuscript Evidence**: Fragments of the Manichaean *Book of Giants* have been found in:
- **Middle Persian** (Pahlavi) — from Turfan (Xinjiang, China)
- **Sogdian** — from Turfan
- **Uighur** (Old Turkic) — from Turfan and other Central Asian sites
- **Coptic** — from Medinet Madi (Fayyum, Egypt)

The fact that a Jewish Aramaic text from Palestine ended up in an Old Turkic translation in the deserts of western China is one of the most remarkable examples of **cultural transmission in human history**.

**Scholarly Analysis**: John C. Reeves, *Jewish Lore in Manichaean Cosmogony: Studies in the Book of Giants Traditions* (1992, Hebrew Union College Press), provides the definitive study tracing the transmission from Jewish to Manichaean contexts. Reeves demonstrated that Mani had access to Enochic literature in its Aramaic/Syriac form and systematically adapted it.

### 2.3 Other Transmitted Texts and Ideas

Beyond the *Book of Giants*, Manichaean missionaries carried:

- **Gnostic cosmology**: the divine spark trapped in matter, the archons (rulers) who imprison light in material bodies, the call to awaken (A03)
- **Zoroastrian eschatology**: cosmic conflagration at the end of time, separation of light from darkness (C19)
- **Christian liturgical practices**: hymns, psalms, confession rituals, community meals
- **Buddhist monastic organization**: the distinction between the "Elect" (*electi* — fully ordained ascetics) and the "Hearers" (*auditores* — lay supporters) mirrors the Buddhist distinction between monks (*bhikkhu*) and lay supporters (*upāsaka*)
- **Astronomical/astrological knowledge**: Manichaean texts contain sophisticated cosmological descriptions of celestial mechanics, zodiacal symbolism, and the movements of light particles through the cosmos

## 3. THE SILK ROAD TRANSMISSION EASTWARD

### 3.1 The Sogdian Vector

The **Sogdians** — an Iranian-speaking people centered on Samarkand and the Zeravshan Valley (modern Uzbekistan/Tajikistan) — were the **primary carriers** of Manichaeism along the Silk Road. Sogdian merchants dominated Central Asian trade from roughly the 4th to the 10th century CE, and their commercial networks became Manichaean missionary networks.

- Sogdian was the *lingua franca* of the Silk Road — a position analogous to English in modern global commerce
- Sogdian Manichaean communities established themselves at oasis cities along the northern and southern routes through the Tarim Basin: Kucha, Turfan (Gaochang), Khotan, Dunhuang
- The Sogdian alphabet (adapted from Aramaic via Syriac) was used to write Manichaean texts — and would later be adapted to create the Uighur, Mongolian, and Manchu scripts

### 3.2 Turfan — The Treasure Trove

The **Turfan oasis** (modern Turpan, Xinjiang, China) became the most important Manichaean center in Central and East Asia. The Turfan discoveries constitute one of the great archaeological finds of the early 20th century:

**The German Turfan Expeditions (1902-1914)**:
- Four expeditions led by **Albert Grünwedel** (1st and 3rd) and **Albert von Le Coq** (2nd and 4th)
- Excavated sites at Bezeklik, Khocho (Gaochang), Toyoq, Murtuq, and other oasis settlements
- Recovered **thousands of manuscript fragments** in Middle Persian, Parthian, Sogdian, Uighur, Chinese, Sanskrit, Tocharian, and other languages
- Manichaean manuscripts included: liturgical texts, hymns, theological treatises, letters, administrative documents, the *Book of Giants* fragments, cosmological diagrams
- Manichaean **paintings and miniatures**: exquisitely detailed works showing Manichaean elect in white robes, cosmic scenes, and religious ceremonies — among the finest examples of Central Asian art

**Current Locations**: The Turfan manuscripts are now divided among:
- Museum für Asiatische Kunst, Berlin (the largest collection)
- Institute of Oriental Manuscripts, Saint Petersburg
- National Museum, New Delhi
- Various Chinese institutions

### 3.3 The Uighur Conversion

The most dramatic episode in Manichaean eastward transmission:

- **762 CE**: The **Uighur Khagan Bögü** (also Mouyu/Mou-yü) visited the Tang Dynasty capital **Luoyang** during a military campaign to help suppress the An Lushan Rebellion
- In Luoyang, Bögü encountered Manichaean missionaries and **converted to Manichaeism**
- Upon returning to the Uighur capital Ordu-Baliq (Karabalghasun, Mongolia), he declared Manichaeism the **state religion** of the Uighur Khaganate
- The **Karabalghasun Inscription** (c. 810 CE, trilingual in Chinese, Sogdian, and Turkic) records this conversion and describes how Manichaeism transformed Uighur society from "blood-drinking barbarians" to a civilized religious people

**Significance**: This is the **only time in history** that Manichaeism became a state religion. The Uighur Khaganate (~744-840 CE) was a major Central Asian power — its adoption of Manichaeism gave the religion political protection, economic resources, and institutional stability for nearly 80 years.

**Uighur Manichaean Texts**: The Uighurs translated Manichaean scriptures into Old Turkic — including the *Book of Giants*. This means that the Jewish-Aramaic Enochic narrative of fallen Watchers and their giant offspring was now being read and recited in a Turkic language by Central Asian nomads, thousands of miles and hundreds of years removed from its Palestinian origins.

### 3.4 After the Khaganate

- **840 CE**: The Uighur Khaganate was destroyed by the Kirghiz, and the Uighurs scattered
- Uighur refugees established kingdoms in the Turfan region (Qocho/Gaochang) and the Gansu corridor, where Manichaeism continued alongside Buddhism and Christianity (Church of the East)
- In the Turfan kingdom (~850-1250 CE), Manichaeism gradually declined as Buddhism became dominant, though Manichaean communities persisted until the Mongol period

## 4. MANICHAEISM IN CHINA

### 4.1 Official Arrival

- **694 CE**: The first documented Manichaean missionary arrived at the Chinese court during the reign of **Empress Wu Zetian** of the Tang Dynasty
- The religion was initially received with suspicion — Chinese officials viewed it as a Persian cult with foreign political connections
- **732 CE**: An imperial edict classified Manichaeism as a "heretical religion" but permitted its practice among foreign residents (Persian and Sogdian merchants)

### 4.2 The Uighur Patronage Period

- After the Uighur conversion (762 CE), **Manichaean temples were built in Chinese cities** under Uighur political pressure — the Tang court could not easily refuse its powerful military ally
- Temples were established in Chang'an (Xi'an), Luoyang, and other major cities
- Chinese Manichaean texts were produced:
  - The **Hymnscroll** (*Xiàbù zàn*): hymns to the Manichaean pantheon in Chinese
  - The **Compendium** (*Moni guang fo jiaofa yilüe*): summary of Manichaean doctrine using Buddhist terminology — Mani is presented as a "Buddha of Light"
  - These texts were found in the **Dunhuang caves** (Cave 17, the "Library Cave," discovered 1900 by Wang Yuanlu)

### 4.3 Suppression and Survival

- **843 CE**: Emperor **Wuzong's** "Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution" (*Huichang Suppression*) targeted all foreign religions — Buddhism, Manichaeism, Nestorian Christianity, and Zoroastrianism
- Manichaean temples were destroyed, clergy forced to laicize
- **Underground survival in Fujian Province**: Manichaeism migrated south and went underground, especially in the maritime trading ports of Fujian
- It became known as the **"Religion of Light"** (明教, *Míngjiào*) — literally, "Bright Teaching" or "Religion of Brightness"
- The *Míngjiào* influenced and was influenced by Chinese Buddhist, Daoist, and folk religious elements

### 4.4 The Ming Dynasty Connection

A persistent scholarly debate asks whether the **Ming Dynasty** (明朝, *Míng cháo*, 1368-1644) — literally meaning "Bright" or "Luminous" Dynasty — has any connection to the Manichaean "Religion of Light" (*Míngjiào*):

- The Ming Dynasty was founded by **Zhu Yuanzhang** (Emperor Hongwu), who rose to power through the **Red Turban Rebellion**
- The Red Turban movement drew on millenarian Buddhist ideas (Maitreya worship) and possibly Manichaean-influenced "Religion of Light" ideology
- Some historians argue that the "Ming" in the dynasty name echoes the Manichaean emphasis on light/brightness
- Others consider this coincidental or at most an indirect influence

**Assessment**: The connection is plausible but not proven (Tier 2/3). What is clear is that Manichaean concepts of cosmic dualism and the triumph of light over darkness entered Chinese popular religious culture and influenced millenarian rebellion movements into the late imperial period.

### 4.5 The Cao'an Temple

The **Cao'an** (草庵) temple in Jinjiang, Fujian Province, is the **only surviving Manichaean temple in China** and quite possibly the only one in the world. Built during the Yuan Dynasty (~13th-14th century CE):

- Contains a stone statue often identified as a **Buddha-like figure of Mani** — depicted with a halo, in meditation posture, wearing monastic robes
- The syncretic appearance — Mani depicted in Buddhist iconographic conventions — perfectly illustrates how Manichaeism adapted to its Chinese environment
- Listed as a Chinese national-level protected cultural heritage site
- Subject of ongoing research by Chinese scholars including Lin Wushu, Ma Xiaohe, and others

## 5. WESTWARD SPREAD AND MEDIEVAL HERESIES

### 5.1 The Roman Empire

Manichaeism spread rapidly westward throughout the Roman Empire in the 3rd-4th centuries CE:

- Reached Egypt, North Africa, Italy, Gaul, and the Iberian Peninsula
- **Diocletian's Edict** (302 CE): the first Roman emperor to specifically target Manichaeism — ordered burning of their books and execution of their leaders. The edict explicitly called Manichaeans agents of the Persian enemy
- Despite persecution, Manichaean communities thrived — particularly in North Africa

### 5.2 Augustine of Hippo

The most famous Manichaean convert was **Augustine of Hippo** (354-430 CE):

- Augustine was a Manichaean "Hearer" (*auditor*) for **nine years** (~373-382 CE)
- He later converted to Christianity and became one of the most influential Christian theologians in history
- In his **Confessions** (397-400 CE), Augustine provided an extended critique of Manichaeism from the perspective of a former believer
- His anti-Manichaean treatises (*Contra Faustum*, *Contra Fortunatum*, *De moribus Manichaeorum*) are among our best sources for Western Manichaean beliefs and practices
- **Irony**: Augustine's own theology — particularly his emphasis on the **problem of evil**, the **two cities** (City of God vs. City of Man), and the **weakness of the human will** — shows detectable Manichaean influence despite his rejection of the religion

### 5.3 The Medieval Heresy Chain

Scholars have debated whether medieval European "dualist heresies" represent **direct descendants** of Manichaeism or **independent rediscoveries** of dualist theology:

- **Paulicians** (7th-9th century, Armenia/Byzantine border): dualist Christians who rejected the Old Testament, the sacraments, and the institutional Church. Some scholars see direct Manichaean influence; others argue for independent development from Marcionism
- **Bogomils** (10th-15th century, Bulgaria and the Balkans): explicitly dualist — the material world was created by Satan (the elder son of God), while Jesus was the Good God's agent. Named after the priest Bogomil (~950 CE). Byzantine sources accuse them of Manichaeism
- **Cathars** (12th-14th century, southern France — Languedoc — and northern Italy): the most well-known medieval dualist movement. "Perfect" (*perfecti*) vs. believers (*credentes*) — structurally similar to Manichaean Elect vs. Hearers. Cathar theology held that the material world was evil, created by an inferior or malevolent deity. The **Albigensian Crusade** (1209-1229) and the Inquisition destroyed the Cathars

**The Chain**: Paulicians → Bogomils → Cathars represents a possible (debated) chain of dualist transmission from East to West across medieval Europe. Whether it traces back ultimately to Manichaeism, Marcionism, or some combination remains contested.

**Connection to N06**: This suppression history fits the broader pattern of institutional destruction of heterodox knowledge traditions.

## 6. THE TRANSMISSION SIGNIFICANCE

### 6.1 What Mani Carried Eastward

The Manichaean missionary network functioned as a **cultural transmission vector**, carrying specific intellectual "packages" across linguistic and ethnic boundaries:

| Package | Origin | Destination | How Transformed |
|---------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Watchers/Giants narrative | Jewish Palestine (1 Enoch) | Central Asia, China | Renamed with Iranian hero names; reframed within Light/Dark dualism |
| Cosmic dualism | Zoroastrian Iran | Mediterranean, China | Merged with Christian soteriology and Buddhist ethics |
| Gnostic divine spark | Egyptian/Syrian Gnosticism | Central/East Asia | Resonated with Buddhist "Buddha-nature" concept |
| Apocalyptic eschatology | Jewish/Christian | Central and East Asia | Influenced Chinese millenarian movements |
| Monastic organization | Buddhist India | Western Roman Empire | Provided administrative structure for Western Manichaean communities |
| Illustrated manuscripts | Mesopotamian/Persian art tradition | Across entire Old World | Created distinctive Manichaean artistic style in each region |

### 6.2 The "Cultural DNA" Metaphor

Manichaean missionaries functioned like **genetic vectors** in epidemiology — carrying specific mythological and theological "genes" across cultural boundaries. These include:

- The **Watchers gene**: the narrative of celestial beings who descend, interact with humans, and produce hybrid offspring — transmitted from Jewish Palestine to Central Asian Turkic peoples
- The **Dualism gene**: the framework of two eternal opposing cosmic principles — transmitted from Iranian religion to Chinese popular thought
- The **Gnosis gene**: the concept of salvific knowledge awakening a divine spark trapped in matter — transmitted from Egyptian/Syrian Christianity to Buddhist-influenced Central Asian religion
- The **Ascetic gene**: the ideal of spiritual purification through renunciation — blending Buddhist, Christian, and Zoroastrian ascetic traditions into a unified practice

### 6.3 Scale of the Achievement

At its height (roughly 3rd-10th century CE), Manichaeism was practiced from **Spain to China** — arguably one of the most geographically widespread religions in human history. It was:

- The state religion of the Uighur Khaganate (Central Asia)
- A significant minority religion in the Sasanian Empire (Iran/Mesopotamia)
- A substantial community in the Roman Empire (North Africa, Italy, Gaul)
- An underground presence in China for centuries
- A literary and artistic tradition producing texts in at least 10 languages

Yet most educated people today have never heard of it. This is partly because:
- It was systematically **suppressed by every major power** — Sasanian Zoroastrians, Roman Christians, Chinese emperors, Islamic authorities
- Its scriptures were deliberately **destroyed** — we have only fragments
- Its history was written by its enemies — Augustine, Titus of Bostra, Chinese bureaucrats who viewed it as subversive

## 7. ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE AND REDISCOVERY

### 7.1 Major Manuscript Finds

| Site | Date Found | Contents | Current Location |
|------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Turfan** (Xinjiang) | 1902-1914 | Thousands of fragments in Middle Persian, Sogdian, Uighur, etc. | Berlin, Saint Petersburg, New Delhi |
| **Dunhuang** Cave 17 | 1900, studied 1907+ | Chinese Manichaean texts (Hymnscroll, Compendium) | British Library, Bibliothèque nationale de France |
| **Medinet Madi** (Fayyum, Egypt) | 1929 | Coptic Manichaean texts (Kephalaia, Psalms, Homilies) | Chester Beatty Library (Dublin), Berlin |
| **Kellis** (Ismant el-Kharab, Egypt) | 1990s | Greek and Coptic Manichaean letters, personal documents | Various Australian institutions |
| **Tebessa** (Algeria) | 1918 | Latin Manichaean codex fragment | — |

### 7.2 The Cologne Mani Codex

Discovered in 1969, the **Cologne Mani Codex** (CMC, P.Colon. inv. 4780) is a tiny Greek parchment codex (3.5 × 4.5 cm — one of the smallest ancient codices known) containing a biography of Mani. It preserves:

- Details of Mani's childhood in the Elcesaite community
- His revelatory experiences
- His early missionary activity
- Quotations from otherwise lost Manichaean texts

The CMC transformed scholarly understanding of Mani's Jewish-Christian origins and demonstrated that Manichaeism grew out of a specifically **Judeo-Christian sectarian** environment, not (as previously assumed) primarily from Zoroastrianism.

### 7.3 Ongoing Research

- **International Association of Manichaean Studies** (founded 1987): organizes biennial conferences and publishes research
- Digital projects to reconstruct fragmented Turfan manuscripts using infrared imaging and digital reassembly
- Chinese scholars continuing fieldwork in Fujian Province, identifying Manichaean elements in local folk religion
- Genetic and isotopic analysis of remains from Manichaean burial sites to understand community composition

## 8. MANICHAEISM AS A TEST CASE FOR CULTURAL TRANSMISSION

### 8.1 What Manichaeism Demonstrates

For this project's core questions about how knowledge traditions cross cultural boundaries, Manichaeism provides a **historically documented example** of exactly the processes we hypothesize for prehistoric periods:

1. **Synthesis at a crossroads**: A figure at a cultural intersection (Mesopotamia) deliberately combines elements from multiple traditions into a coherent system
2. **Missionary transmission**: Dedicated carriers (missionaries, merchants) transport the synthesized system along existing trade/communication networks
3. **Linguistic adaptation**: The system is translated into each new language, with local terminology substituted (Buddhist terms in China, Iranian hero names in Central Asia)
4. **Institutional embedding**: Where political power supports it (Uighur Khaganate), the system becomes established; where it's opposed (Roman Empire, Sasanian Iran), it goes underground
5. **Fragmentation and survival**: After institutional destruction, elements survive in folk religion, heterodox movements, and underground communities
6. **Suppression by competitors**: Dominant religions (Christianity, Islam, Zoroastrianism) systematically destroy Manichaean texts and communities — yet cannot fully erase the transmitted ideas

### 8.2 Implications for Prehistoric Transmission

If Manichaeism could carry the Jewish *Book of Giants* from Palestine to the Turkic-speaking peoples of Central Asia in ~500 years using the Silk Road, then:

- Neolithic and Bronze Age trade networks (amber routes, obsidian trade, maritime networks) could similarly transmit mythological narratives over comparable or greater distances
- The cross-cultural mythological parallels documented throughout this project (C01, C08) become **historically plausible** — they don't require supernatural explanation, just sustained cultural contact
- The key variable is the **existence of a transmission network** — and we know such networks existed in prehistory from archaeological evidence (trade goods, shared technologies, artistic styles)

### 8.3 Complications for Phylogenetics

Manichaeism also presents a **complication** for the phylogenetic analysis described in P13:

- It created **artificial phylogenetic signals** — making Jewish myths appear in Central Asian traditions not because of population migration (the signal phylogenetics usually tracks) but because of **ideological transmission**
- This means phylogenetic trees of mythology may be "polluted" by historical transmission events
- However, the Manichaean example also shows that such transmission events are typically **documentable** — we can identify them and account for them in the analysis

This document is overwhelmingly **Tier 1** in reliability. Manichaeism is exceptionally well-documented for a suppressed religion — we have:

- Physical manuscripts in at least 10 languages from sites across three continents
- Archaeological sites (Turfan, Dunhuang, Kellis, Medinet Madi, Cao'an)
- Contemporary hostile accounts (Augustine, Roman edicts, Zoroastrian polemics, Chinese administrative records) that corroborate the religion's existence and spread
- The Cologne Mani Codex providing a near-contemporary biography
- Active, well-funded international scholarship

The only elements reaching Tier 2/3 are specific interpretive claims like the Ming Dynasty name connection and detailed reconstructions of Manichaean theology where our fragmentary sources are supplemented by scholarly inference.
