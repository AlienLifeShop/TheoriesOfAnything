## QUICK SUMMARY

The question of pre-Columbian contact between Polynesia and South America has moved from fringe speculation to mainstream acceptance, driven by converging lines of evidence from botany, linguistics, genetics, and archaeology. The sweet potato (*Ipomoea batatas*), a South American domesticate, was widely cultivated across Polynesia before European contact, with the linguistic parallel between Quechua "kumar" and Polynesian "kumara" suggesting direct cultural transmission. A landmark 2020 genomic study (Ioannidis et al., *Nature*) detected ancient Native American DNA in Polynesian populations dating to approximately 1200 CE. The direction of contact appears to have been primarily Polynesian voyagers reaching South America—not the reverse, as Thor Heyerdahl famously proposed.

## 1. VERIFIED CLAIMS (Tier 1 — Peer-Reviewed / Archaeological Record)

### 1.1 Sweet Potato in Pre-Columbian Polynesia
- The sweet potato (*Ipomoea batatas*) is definitively of South American origin, domesticated in the Peru-Ecuador region.
- It was present throughout Polynesia before any European contact: in New Zealand, Hawai'i, Easter Island (Rapanui), the Cook Islands, Marquesas, and Tonga.
- Carbonized sweet potato remains from the Cook Islands dated to ~1000-1100 CE (Hather & Kirch, 1991).
- No natural dispersal mechanism can explain sweet potato crossing the Pacific—it does not survive prolonged ocean immersion.

### 1.2 Linguistic Evidence: Kumar / Kumara
- In Quechua (Andean language family): "kumar" or "cumar" = sweet potato.
- In multiple Polynesian languages: "kumara" (Maori, Cook Islands Maori), "kumala" (Tongan, Samoan), "'uala" (Hawaiian, likely from different etymological root).
- This linguistic convergence was noted as early as 1916 by Roland Dixon.
- The shared name strongly suggests cultural transmission rather than independent adoption.

### 1.3 Polynesian Navigation Capability
- Polynesian voyagers definitively colonized the entire Pacific triangle (Hawai'i, New Zealand, Rapanui) using non-instrument navigation.
- Easter Island (Rapanui), the closest Polynesian island to South America, is ~3,700 km from Chile.
- The distance from Rapanui to South America is well within documented Polynesian voyaging range.
- Experimental voyages (Hōkūleʻa, 1976–present) confirmed Pacific-wide navigation using traditional methods.

### 1.4 Genomic Evidence (2020)
- Ioannidis et al. (2020, *Nature*): analyzed genomic data from modern Polynesian and South American populations.
- Detected a clear signal of Native American admixture in Polynesian populations on several eastern Polynesian islands.
- The genetic contact dated to approximately 1150–1230 CE, consistent with the Polynesian expansion period.
- Strongest signal found in inhabitants of Fatu Hiva (Marquesas), with additional signals in Rapanui and Palliser Atoll.
- The Native American genetic component was most similar to the Zenu people of Colombia.

## 2. CREDIBLE CLAIMS (Tier 2 — Academic / Debated but Supported)

### 2.1 Chicken DNA Debate
- Storey et al. (2007, *PNAS*): reported pre-Columbian Polynesian chicken bones at El Arenal, Chile, dated to ~1321–1407 CE.
- DNA analysis initially suggested a Polynesian origin for these chickens.
- Thomson et al. (2014): challenged the results, arguing contamination and questioning the radiocarbon dates.
- The debate remains active: if confirmed, this represents direct archaeological evidence of Polynesian presence in South America.
- Chickens (*Gallus gallus*) were domesticated in Southeast Asia and carried across the Pacific by Polynesian settlers.

### 2.2 Bottle Gourd (*Lagenaria siceraria*)
- The bottle gourd is native to Africa but was present in the pre-Columbian Americas by at least 10,000 years ago.
- Clarke et al. (2006): DNA analysis suggested Asian origin for American bottle gourds, potentially carried across the Pacific.
- Erickson et al. (2005): proposed ocean drift as a possible dispersal mechanism (gourds can float for extended periods while remaining viable).
- The bottle gourd may represent a much older trans-Pacific transfer than the sweet potato.

### 2.3 Direction of Contact: Polynesian → South America
- Prevailing winds and currents favor eastward voyaging from Polynesia to South America (with difficulty).
- Polynesian navigational skills far exceeded anything documented among pre-Columbian South American coastal peoples.
- The Humboldt Current runs northward along the Chilean coast, potentially aiding return voyages.
- Most scholars now favor Polynesian voyagers reaching South America, possibly making contact with coastal populations, obtaining sweet potato, and returning.

### 2.4 Rapanui (Easter Island) as Waypoint
- Easter Island is geographically intermediate between Polynesia and South America.
- Rapanui culture shows potential South American influences: stone masonry techniques, possible *totora* reed cultivation.
- *Totora* reeds (*Schoenoplectus tatora*): used for boats on Lake Titicaca (Bolivia/Peru); also found on Easter Island—debated whether introduced or naturally occurring.
- Rapanui sweet potato varieties show high genetic diversity, suggesting long cultivation history.

## 3. SPECULATIVE CLAIMS (Tier 3 — Possible but Unverified)

### 3.1 Multiple Contact Events
- The genomic evidence suggests at least one contact event (~1200 CE), but there may have been multiple.
- Sweet potato may have been transferred separately from the genetic admixture event.
- Different Polynesian island groups may have had independent contacts with different South American populations.

### 3.2 South American Maritime Capability
- Evidence of Ecuadorian *balsa* raft voyaging (Spondylus shell trade along Pacific coast) suggests some deep-water capability.
- Chinchorro, Moche, and Chimú cultures had maritime traditions, but long-distance Pacific voyaging is unattested.
- The Manteño-Huancavilca culture (Ecuador, ~800-1532 CE) used large balsa sailing rafts for coastal trade.
- If South Americans could reach the Galápagos Islands (~1,000 km offshore), longer voyages were theoretically possible.

### 3.3 Additional Crop Transfers
- Coconut (*Cocos nucifera*): debates over whether its presence on both sides of the Pacific reflects human transfer or natural dispersal.
- Cotton (*Gossypium*): pre-Columbian American cotton (G. hirsutum, G. barbadense) contains an Old World genome (G. herbaceum), suggesting ancient hybridization event—timing and mechanism debated.
- Various other plant species have been proposed as trans-Pacific transfers, but evidence is generally weaker than for sweet potato.

### 3.4 Cultural Parallels
- Some scholars note similarities between Polynesian and South American cultural elements:
  - Monumental stone construction (Rapanui moai vs. Andean stone masonry).
  - Quipu-like knotted string devices in parts of Polynesia.
  - Canoe designs with some shared features.
- Cultural parallels are difficult to evaluate: they may reflect contact, independent invention, or confirmation bias.

## 4. DUBIOUS CLAIMS (Tier 4 — No Credible Source)

### 4.1 Heyerdahl's South American Origin Theory
- Thor Heyerdahl's Kon-Tiki expedition (1947): sailed a balsa raft from Peru to Tuamotu Islands, proving the voyage was possible.
- However, Heyerdahl's core thesis—that Polynesians originated from South America—is genetically and linguistically disproven.
- Polynesians are definitively of Austronesian (Southeast Asian) origin, with partial Melanesian ancestry.
- Kon-Tiki proved feasibility of drift voyaging but not that it actually happened in the proposed direction.

### 4.2 White-Skinned "Gods" from the East
- Heyerdahl and others promoted the idea of light-skinned civilizers (Kon-Tiki/Viracocha) reaching Polynesia from South America.
- This narrative has racist undertones, implying Polynesian culture required external civilizing influence.
- No credible evidence supports a civilizing migration from South America to Polynesia.
- Polynesian cultural achievements are indigenous and well-documented archaeologically.

### 4.3 Massive Pre-Columbian Trade Networks
- No evidence for regular, sustained commercial trade between Polynesia and South America.
- Contact, if it occurred, was likely episodic—one or a few voyages, not established routes.
- Claims of extensive trans-Pacific trade empires are unsupported by the archaeological or genetic record.
