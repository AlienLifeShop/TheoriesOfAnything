## QUICK SUMMARY

Sub-Saharan Africa was deeply integrated into global trade networks for millennia, challenging Eurocentric narratives that portray the continent as isolated before European colonization. The Indian Ocean dhow trade connected East Africa to Arabia, India, Southeast Asia, and China through sophisticated use of monsoon wind patterns. The Swahili coast cities—Kilwa, Mombasa, Lamu, Zanzibar—were cosmopolitan trading hubs exchanging African gold, ivory, and iron for Chinese porcelain, Indian textiles, and Arabian glassware. Inland, Great Zimbabwe served as the economic engine of a gold-trading empire, while the trans-Saharan routes carried gold, salt, and ideas across the continent's interior. African maritime technology, including sewn boats and outrigger canoes, enabled participation in these networks.

## 1. VERIFIED CLAIMS (Tier 1 — Peer-Reviewed / Archaeological Record)

### 1.1 Indian Ocean Dhow Trade
- Maritime exchange across the Indian Ocean dates back at least 2,000 years, with African participation documented from the early centuries CE.
- The *Periplus of the Erythraean Sea* (1st century CE Greek text) describes active trade along the East African coast, naming ports such as Rhapta (possibly near modern Dar es Salaam).
- Dhow sailing routes relied on monsoon wind reversals: northeast monsoon (November–March) for southward voyages; southwest monsoon (April–October) for northward return.
- This seasonal pattern created a reliable, repeating cycle of maritime trade.

### 1.2 Swahili Coast City-States
- Urban centers along the East African coast from Mogadishu to Sofala flourished from ~800–1500 CE.
- **Kilwa Kisiwani** (modern Tanzania): Major gold-trading entrepôt; Great Mosque (13th century) is one of the oldest surviving mosques in sub-Saharan Africa.
- **Mombasa, Lamu, Zanzibar, Pemba, Comoros**: All had established trading communities.
- Swahili civilization was a synthesis of Bantu African, Arab, Persian, and Indian cultural elements.
- Archaeological evidence: Chinese porcelain (Song, Yuan, Ming dynasties), Indian beads, Persian Gulf ceramics, and local African ironwork found throughout Swahili sites.

### 1.3 Great Zimbabwe and the Gold Trade
- Great Zimbabwe (11th–15th century CE): massive stone-walled complex in modern Zimbabwe, center of a cattle-herding and gold-trading state.
- Gold from the Zimbabwe Plateau was traded through the port of Sofala (Mozambique) to Kilwa, and from there to India, Arabia, and China.
- Archaeological finds at Great Zimbabwe include Chinese celadon pottery, glass beads from India, and Near Eastern coins.
- The Mutapa Kingdom (successor state, 15th–17th century) continued the gold trade until Portuguese disruption.

### 1.4 Trans-Saharan Trade Routes
- Trade across the Sahara dates to at least 1000 BCE (Garamantes chariot routes).
- Major commodities: gold (from Bambuk and Bure goldfields), salt (from Saharan deposits at Taghaza, Idjil), slaves, cloth, horses, kola nuts.
- Key trading cities: Timbuktu, Djenné, Gao, Sijilmasa, Awdaghust.
- Ghana Empire (~300–1200 CE), Mali Empire (~1235–1600 CE), Songhai Empire (~1464–1591 CE) controlled trans-Saharan trade.
- Mansa Musa's pilgrimage to Mecca (1324 CE): distributed so much gold in Cairo that he reportedly depressed the price of gold for a decade.

### 1.5 Archaeological Confirmation of Long-Distance Trade
- Glass beads of Indian Ocean origin found at Mapungubwe (South Africa, ~1075–1220 CE).
- Cowrie shells from the Indian Ocean found deep in the African interior.
- Iron production: sub-Saharan Africa independently developed iron smelting (earliest evidence from Nok culture, Nigeria, ~900 BCE, and even earlier contested dates from East Africa).
- Copper ingots from Katanga (Congo) traded across vast distances as currency.

## 2. CREDIBLE CLAIMS (Tier 2 — Academic / Debated but Supported)

### 2.1 Kilwa Coins on Wessel Islands, Australia
- Five copper coins identified as Kilwa sultanate mintage (10th–14th century CE) were found on Wessel Islands, Northern Territory, Australia, in 1944.
- Additional coin from the Dutch East India Company found at the same site.
- Origin of the Kilwa coins: debated whether they represent direct Kilwa-Australia contact, Macassan trepang fishermen intermediaries, or later accidental deposition.
- The find is genuine but its interpretation remains contested.

### 2.2 African Maritime Technology
- **Sewn boats (mtepe):** Planks sewn together with coconut fiber, without nails—a distinctive East African/Indian Ocean boatbuilding tradition.
- **Outrigger canoes:** Present in Madagascar and parts of East Africa, derived from Austronesian (Indonesian) settlement of Madagascar (~500 CE).
- **Reed boats:** Used on Lake Chad, Lake Victoria, and rivers throughout Africa.
- **Dugout canoes:** Primary inland watercraft, some of enormous size (capable of carrying 100+ people on Congo River).
- Swahili coast communities were skilled sailors, though they typically served as traders rather than naval powers.

### 2.3 Austronesian Settlement of Madagascar
- Madagascar was settled primarily by Austronesian-speaking peoples from Borneo/Sulawesi (~500 CE), with subsequent Bantu African admixture.
- This represents a 6,000+ km Indian Ocean crossing—one of the longest maritime migrations in history.
- Malagasy language is Austronesian (closest to Ma'anyan of Borneo), despite Madagascar's location off the African coast.
- Outrigger canoe technology, rice cultivation, and banana cultivation likely entered Africa via Madagascar.
- The banana (*Musa* spp.) —an Asian domesticate—was widespread in sub-Saharan Africa before European contact, requiring human introduction.

### 2.4 African Participation Beyond Passive Trade
- African merchants were not merely passive recipients of foreign traders.
- Swahili merchants actively sailed to India, Arabia, and possibly beyond.
- Kilwa minted its own copper coinage—unusual for East African states—indicating monetary sophistication.
- African ivory was preferred in India and China over Asian elephant ivory (softer, easier to carve).
- African iron was exported to India (high-quality carbon steel from East Africa contributed to Indian wootz steel production—debated).

## 3. SPECULATIVE CLAIMS (Tier 3 — Possible but Unverified)

### 3.1 African Voyages to India and China
- While Indian and Arab merchants demonstrably visited Africa, evidence of African merchants reaching China is sparse.
- Chinese records mention "Kunlun" people (dark-skinned foreigners, possibly Africans or Southeast Asians) arriving in Chinese ports.
- African slaves and servants documented in Tang Dynasty China, but their arrival route is unclear (possibly via Arab intermediaries).

### 3.2 Pre-Islamic African Maritime Networks
- The extent of African Indian Ocean participation before the Islamic era (~7th century CE) is poorly understood.
- Rhapta (mentioned in the *Periplus*) has never been definitively located or excavated.
- Iron Age coastal sites in Tanzania and Kenya may push maritime trade evidence earlier.

### 3.3 Trans-Atlantic African Contact
- Some researchers have proposed African maritime contact with the Americas based on:
  - Olmec colossal heads (claimed African features—rejected by most scholars as stereotyping).
  - Linguistic parallels between Mande languages and some Indigenous American languages (Ivan Van Sertima's thesis—poorly received academically).
  - Botanical evidence: African bottle gourd, cotton, and other crops in the pre-Columbian Americas.
- Current scholarly consensus does not support direct African-American trans-Atlantic contact before the modern era.

### 3.4 Extent of Chinese Trade in East Africa
- Chinese ceramics are found at East African sites from the 9th century onward, but the degree of direct Chinese presence is debated.
- Zheng He's fleet visited Mogadishu, Malindi, and possibly Kilwa (1418–1421 CE) (→ F15).
- Claims of Chinese settlements or garrisons in East Africa are not supported by archaeological evidence.

## 4. DUBIOUS CLAIMS (Tier 4 — No Credible Source)

### 4.1 Van Sertima's "They Came Before Columbus"
- Ivan Van Sertima (1976) argued for pre-Columbian African contact with the Americas, citing Olmec heads, plant transfers, and alleged African cultural influence.
- The thesis has been substantially criticized for methodological flaws, selective evidence, and anachronistic reasoning.
- Olmec heads represent local Indigenous peoples, not Africans.
- While motivated by correcting racist historiography, the claims are not supported by current evidence.

### 4.2 Great Zimbabwe as Non-African Construction
- Colonial-era claims that Great Zimbabwe was built by Phoenicians, Arabs, or other non-Africans were motivated by racist ideology.
- Archaeological consensus (since Gertrude Caton-Thompson, 1931) conclusively attributes Great Zimbabwe to ancestral Shona peoples.
- Material culture, construction techniques, and regional archaeology all confirm local African origin.

### 4.3 Regular Trans-Indian-Ocean Voyages to Australia
- While the Kilwa coins on the Wessel Islands are genuine, claims of regular African maritime contact with Australia are unsupported.
- Macassan trepang (sea cucumber) fishermen from Sulawesi visited northern Australia regularly (17th–20th century), providing a more parsimonious explanation for artifact dispersal.
