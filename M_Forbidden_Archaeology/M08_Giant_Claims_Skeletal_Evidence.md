## QUICK SUMMARY

Claims of **giant human skeletons** unearthed in the Americas constitute one of the most persistent themes in **forbidden archaeology** and popular alternative history. Hundreds of **19th-century newspaper accounts** report discoveries of human remains ranging from **7 to 12+ feet** in mound excavations across Ohio, West Virginia, Tennessee, Minnesota, and elsewhere. These accounts are intertwined with the **"Mound Builder" myth** — the now-debunked 19th-century idea that a **lost race** (variously identified as Israelites, Phoenicians, Welsh, or Atlanteans) built the massive earthworks of the Eastern United States, rather than the indigenous peoples who actually constructed them. The mound builder myth was **explicitly racist**, reflecting settlers' refusal to credit Native Americans with complex civilization (→ H08). Modern archaeology has conclusively established that the mounds were built by **indigenous cultures**: **Poverty Point** (~1700-1100 BCE, Louisiana), **Adena** (~1000-200 BCE, Ohio Valley), **Hopewell** (~200 BCE-500 CE, Ohio/Midwest), **Mississippian** (~800-1600 CE, Cahokia the largest with ~20,000 residents), and others. The **giant skeleton claims** specifically suffer from: (1) **no extant specimens** — despite hundreds of reported finds, not a single verified giant skeleton exists in any museum or collection; (2) **newspaper unreliability** — 19th-century papers are documented as routinely publishing tall tales, hoaxes, and sensationalized stories; (3) **measurement error** — articulated vs. disarticulated bones are easily misjudged; (4) **known tall populations** — some individuals in any population reach 6'6"-7' naturally, and this height seemed "giant" to 19th-century Americans who averaged 5'7"; (5) **pathological gigantism** — acromegaly, Marfan syndrome, and pituitary disorders produce rare genuinely tall individuals. The modern **"Smithsonian cover-up"** narrative (popularized by Jim Vieira, Micah Ewers, and various alternative media) claims the institution systematically destroyed giant remains to protect mainstream evolutionary theory. This claim has **no documentary evidence** and relies on circular reasoning ("the absence of evidence proves the cover-up"). Nevertheless, the persistence of **giant traditions** across cultures worldwide (→ B10) — Greek Titans, Norse Jötnar, Hebrew Nephilim/Anakim, Patagonian giants — raises legitimate questions about the mythological/psychological significance of giant motifs in human storytelling.

## 1. THE MOUND BUILDER MYTH

### 1.1 Historical Context

When European settlers encountered the massive earthworks of the Ohio Valley and Mississippi River region, many refused to believe that the ancestors of the Native Americans they were displacing could have built them:

| Date | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1780s-1800s | Early explorers (Caleb Atwater, others) describe mounds; speculation about builders begins |
| 1820s-1840s | "Lost race" theories proliferate — Israelites, Welsh (Madoc legend), Phoenicians, Hindus claimed as builders |
| 1848 | Squier & Davis publish *Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley* — first systematic survey by the Smithsonian |
| 1882 | **Cyrus Thomas** appointed by Bureau of Ethnology to resolve the question |
| 1894 | Thomas publishes *Report on the Mound Explorations of the Bureau of Ethnology* — **conclusively demonstrates** continuity between mound builders and living Native Americans |
| Post-1894 | Academic consensus settles: mounds are indigenous. Popular myth persists in reduced form |

### 1.2 The Racist Function of the Myth

The mound builder myth served a specific **political purpose**: if a "lost race" built the mounds and was subsequently destroyed by "savage" Indians, then:
- Native Americans had no valid claim to the land as original inhabitants
- European displacement of Native Americans was justified — they were merely the latest wave of conquest
- The "lost race" narrative aligned with Manifest Destiny ideology

This is a textbook case of **motivated reasoning in scholarship** (→ H08): ideological needs shaped "scientific" conclusions.

## 2. ACTUAL MOUND CULTURES

### 2.1 Major Traditions

| Culture | Period | Region | Key Features |
|---------|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Watson Brake** | ~3500 BCE | Louisiana | Oldest known mound complex in North America; 11 mounds; challenges "mounds = complex society" assumption |
| **Poverty Point** | ~1700-1100 BCE | Louisiana | Massive earthwork complex; 6 concentric ridges, central mound; trade network spanning 1,000+ miles |
| **Adena** | ~1000-200 BCE | Ohio Valley | Conical burial mounds (e.g., Grave Creek Mound, 69 feet tall); copper ornaments; tubular pipes |
| **Hopewell** | ~200 BCE-500 CE | Ohio, Midwest | Elaborate geometric earthworks (Newark, Ohio); pan-continental trade (obsidian from Yellowstone, shells from Gulf, copper from Great Lakes, mica from Appalachians) |
| **Mississippian** | ~800-1600 CE | Mississippi Valley, Southeast | Platform mounds; **Cahokia** (largest pre-Columbian city north of Mexico, ~20,000 residents); Monks Mound (100 feet tall, base larger than Great Pyramid of Giza); hierarchical chiefdom social organization |
| **Fort Ancient** | ~1000-1750 CE | Ohio Valley | Large hilltop enclosures; **Serpent Mound** (1,348 feet long) — one of the world's largest effigy mounds |
| **Effigy Mound** | ~350-1300 CE | Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota | Animal-shaped mounds (birds, bears, panthers); burial function; thousands constructed |

### 2.2 Cahokia — America's Forgotten City

Cahokia (near modern St. Louis) was the **largest pre-Columbian settlement** north of Mexico:
- Population: ~20,000-40,000 at peak (c. 1100 CE) — larger than contemporary London
- **Monks Mound**: 100 feet tall, 14 acres at base (larger footprint than Giza's Great Pyramid)
- **Woodhenge**: Calendar circle of wooden posts (solar observatory)
- Palisaded central precinct with elite residences
- Declined by ~1400 CE — causes debated (environmental degradation, political instability, climate change, warfare)

## 3. GIANT SKELETON CLAIMS

### 3.1 The Newspaper Record

Hundreds of 19th- and early 20th-century newspaper articles report discoveries of **unusually large human remains** during mound excavations. Representative examples:

| Date | Location | Reported Height | Source | Reliability Assessment |
|------|----------|----------------|--------|----------------------|
| 1883 | Kanawha Valley, WV | 7'6" | *various papers* | Bureau of Ethnology excavated this area; no giant remains in official reports |
| 1886 | Ellsworth, ME | 7'2" | *Ellsworth American* | Small-town paper; no follow-up verification |
| 1891 | Crittenden, AZ | "Sarcophagus of a giant" | *Arizona Gazette* | Sensational language; no archaeological record |
| 1897 | Maple Creek, WI | 9 feet | Multiple papers | Classic tall tale; no specimens preserved |
| 1912 | Catalina Island, CA | Various oversized remains | Ralph Glidden | Glidden was a commercial excavator and showman; collections dispersed; measurements never verified by physical anthropologists |

### 3.2 Why the Newspaper Record Is Unreliable

| Problem | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Tall tale tradition** | 19th-century American newspapers routinely published **deliberate hoaxes** and sensationalized stories — this was considered entertainment, not journalism by modern standards; the Cardiff Giant (1869) was explicitly created as a hoax and fooled thousands |
| **Measurement error** | Disarticulated bones are easily misjudged; laying out a skeleton with spaces between bones can add 6-12 inches to apparent height; untrained observers consistently overestimate |
| **Telegraph game** | Stories were reprinted and embellished as they moved between papers; "tall man" became "giant" became "race of giants" |
| **No verification** | Not a single reported "giant" was measured and documented by a trained physical anthropologist with the remains preserved for independent examination |
| **Survivorship bias** | Of thousands of mound excavations, the few that reported unusual finds are remembered; the vast majority that found normal-sized remains are forgotten |

### 3.3 What Actual Physical Evidence Shows

| Evidence | Finding |
|----------|---------|
| **Museum collections** | Major museums (Smithsonian, Peabody, Ohio History Connection) hold thousands of mound-era skeletal remains; **none** exceed ~6'8" — tall but within normal human range |
| **Adena "giants"** | Some Adena burials do show taller-than-average individuals (~6'0"-6'6"); this is well within normal variation; Adena diet and genetics may have produced above-average height for the period |
| **Pathological cases** | Genuine gigantism (pituitary adenoma, acromegaly, Marfan syndrome) produces rare individuals of 7'+ height in any population; these are medical cases, not evidence of a "race of giants" |
| **Average heights** | Pre-contact Native Americans in many regions were **taller than contemporary Europeans** (averaging ~5'8"-5'10" vs. ~5'5"-5'7"); European observers may have perceived them as "giants" relative to their own stature |

## 4. THE SMITHSONIAN CONSPIRACY CLAIM

### 4.1 The Narrative

Modern alternative history proponents (especially Jim Vieira, popularized via *Search for the Lost Giants* on the History Channel) claim:
- The Smithsonian Institution systematically collected and **destroyed giant skeletons** in the 19th-20th centuries
- This was done to protect Darwinian evolutionary theory and mainstream archaeology
- NAGPRA (Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, 1990) was used as cover to destroy remaining evidence
- The "cover-up" proves that mainstream science suppresses paradigm-threatening evidence (→ H08)

### 4.2 Problems with This Claim

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|---------|
| **No documentary evidence** | Despite the Smithsonian's enormous archival record, no internal memo, letter, report, or directive referencing destruction of giant remains has ever been found |
| **Circular reasoning** | "The absence of evidence is evidence of cover-up" — unfalsifiable logic that can justify any conspiracy claim |
| **Motive doesn't hold** | Genuine giant skeletons (pathological or otherwise) would not threaten evolutionary theory — medical gigantism is well understood; a tall individual is not evidence of a "separate race" |
| **NAGPRA misrepresentation** | NAGPRA requires **repatriation to tribal nations**, not destruction; tribes themselves determine the disposition of repatriated remains; this is a sovereignty and dignity issue, not a cover-up |
| **Smithsonian collections are accessible** | The National Museum of Natural History's physical anthropology collections are available to qualified researchers by appointment; they have not been secreted away |
| **The Smithsonian actively debunked the Mound Builder myth** | Cyrus Thomas's 1894 report, funded by the Smithsonian, proved mounds were built by Native Americans — the institution fought the "lost race" myth rather than promoting it |

## 5. GIANT TRADITIONS IN MYTHOLOGY (→ B10)

While the physical evidence for a "race of giants" is absent, **giant motifs** are genuinely universal in human mythology:

| Tradition | Giants | Context |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Hebrew Bible** | Nephilim, Anakim, Rephaim, Goliath | Antediluvian beings; inhabitants of Canaan before Israelite conquest (→ B10) |
| **Greek** | Titans, Gigantes, Cyclopes | Primordial beings overthrown by Olympians; cosmic succession myth |
| **Norse** | Jötnar (frost/fire giants); Ymir | Cosmos created from body of primordial giant; giants as forces of chaos (→ A12) |
| **Hindu** | Daityas, Danavas, Rakshasas | Giant adversaries of the Devas; cosmic warfare (→ A11) |
| **Patagonian giants** | "Patagonians" | Magellan's expedition (1520) reported giants in Patagonia; persisted on maps for 250 years; debunked by later travelers (Tehuelche people were tall, ~6', but not giants) |
| **Native American** | Strendu (Haudenosaunee), Si-Te-Cah (Paiute), Tsul'Kalu (Cherokee) | Culture-specific giant beings; often pre-human inhabitants; may encode population displacement memories |

**Interpretive frameworks** for universal giant traditions:
- **Misidentified megafauna bones** — elephant, mammoth, whale, and dinosaur bones have been interpreted as "giant human" remains in many cultures (Adrienne Mayor, *The First Fossil Hunters*)
- **Cosmic succession** — the "giants came first, then humans" motif encodes myths of cosmic ordering, the taming of chaos (→ A16)
- **Cultural memory of tall populations** — some traditions may encode genuine encounters with taller peoples
- **Psychological archetype** — the giant as embodiment of overwhelming power, the monstrous, the pre-civilized

## 6. COUNTER-ARGUMENTS AND SCHOLARLY DEBATE

| Claim | Supporting Evidence | Counter-Evidence | Assessment |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| Giant skeletons were found in American mounds | Hundreds of newspaper reports; some early archaeological accounts mention tall individuals | No extant specimens; newspapers unreliable; measurement errors documented; official Bureau of Ethnology reports don't corroborate | **Tier 3-4**: Extraordinary claim with no surviving physical evidence despite hundreds of alleged finds |
| A "race of giants" predated Native Americans | Widespread giant traditions; some mound excavation reports; Nephilim/Anakim biblical tradition (→ B10) | No genetic, archaeological, or physical anthropological evidence; contradicts all modern understanding of human variation | **Tier 4**: No scientific support; rooted in mound builder myth and biblical literalism |
| The Smithsonian destroyed giant evidence | Large-scale institutional capacity; temporal correlation with mound excavation era; some remains are unaccounted for | Zero documentary evidence of destruction; Smithsonian debunked mound builder myth; collections are accessible; motive illogical | **Tier 4**: Conspiracy claim with no supporting evidence |
| Mounds were built by indigenous peoples | Cyrus Thomas (1894) conclusive report; continuity in material culture; oral traditions of descendant peoples; radiocarbon dating; NAGPRA-era identification | Essentially none — academic consensus since 1890s | **Tier 1**: Scientific consensus backed by overwhelming evidence |
