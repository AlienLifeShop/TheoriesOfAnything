## QUICK SUMMARY

The **Enuma Elish** ("When on high…") is the **Babylonian creation epic** — a cosmogonic poem of approximately 1,100 lines inscribed on **seven clay tablets**, composed ca. **1100 BCE** (though likely drawing on older traditions back to the Old Babylonian period, ~1800 BCE). It tells how **Marduk**, the patron god of Babylon, rose from junior deity to **king of the gods** by defeating the primordial chaos dragon **Tiamat** — then split her body to create heaven and earth, established cosmic order, and created humanity from the blood of **Kingu** (Tiamat's consort). The text is simultaneously a **cosmogony** (creation story), a **theogony** (divine genealogy), and a **political charter** — it justifies Babylon's supremacy and Marduk's position at the head of the divine assembly (→ A16). It was ritually recited every year at the **Akitu (New Year) festival** in Babylon. The Enuma Elish has profound connections to **Genesis 1** (→ A02); the Hebrew *tehom* ("the deep") appears to derive from *Tiamat*, and the seven-day structure of creation may echo the seven tablets. It also provides the archetypal **chaoskampf** (chaos-combat) pattern that recurs in the Baal Cycle (→ A17), Hittite myths (→ C58), Greek Titanomachy, and Norse Ragnarök.

## 2. THE NARRATIVE

### 2.1 Tablets I–VII Summary [5/5 sources]

| Tablet | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **I** | In the beginning, only **Apsu** (fresh water, male) and **Tiamat** (salt water, female) exist. Their mingling generates successive pairs of gods. The noise of younger gods disturbs Apsu, who plots to destroy them. **Ea** (Enki) learns of the plot, kills Apsu, and builds his temple on the corpse. Ea's son **Marduk** is born — magnificent, with four eyes and four ears. |
| **II** | Tiamat, enraged by Apsu's death, creates 11 **monster-creatures** (serpent-dragons, lion-demons, scorpion-men, fish-men). She elevates **Kingu** as her consort and gives him the **Tablet of Destinies** (→ A06). The gods panic. Ea and Anu fail to face her. |
| **III** | The gods assemble (→ A16). **Anshar** summons the divine council. Marduk volunteers to fight Tiamat — but demands supreme kingship as payment. |
| **IV** | The gods test Marduk's power by having him destroy and recreate a constellation. Satisfied, they grant him kingship. Marduk arms himself with winds, storms, and a net. He confronts Tiamat, drives an evil wind into her mouth, and slays her with an arrow through her heart. He captures Kingu and takes the Tablet of Destinies. |
| **V** | Marduk **splits Tiamat's body**: her upper half becomes the sky, her lower half the earth. He establishes the stars, constellations, calendar, moon phases. He creates the **Tigris and Euphrates** from her eyes. |
| **VI** | Marduk creates **humanity** from the blood of Kingu — humans are made to serve the gods, freeing them from labor. He builds **Babylon** and **Esagila** (Marduk's temple). The gods praise him with **50 names**. |
| **VII** | Continuation of the 50 names of Marduk, each encoding a theological attribute. Final instruction that the poem should be handed down, taught to future generations. |

### 2.2 Tiamat's Eleven Monster-Creatures [4/5 sources]

| Creature | Significance |
|----------|--------------|
| **Mušḫuššu** (serpent-dragon) | Composite creature — later becomes Marduk's own symbol on the Ishtar Gate |
| **Ušumgallu** (great serpent) | Primordial serpent force (→ B01) |
| **Bašmu** (venomous snake) | Horned serpent |
| **Laḫmu** (hairy hero) | Monstrous guardian figure |
| **Ugallu** (great lion) | Lion-demon |
| **Rabid dog** | Chaos beast |
| **Scorpion-man** | Guardians later appear in Gilgamesh epic |
| **Fish-man (kulullû)** | Connected to Oannes/Apkallu (→ A07) |
| **Other monsters** | Storm-beings, bull-men, additional dragons |

## 3. THEOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL FUNCTION

### 3.1 Marduk's Rise as Political Theology [5/5 sources]

| Level | Function |
|-------|----------|
| **Cosmic** | Establishes the origin of cosmos from primordial chaos |
| **Theogonic** | Explains divine hierarchy — why Marduk reigns supreme over older gods |
| **Political** | Justifies Babylon's supremacy — other cities' gods willingly submitted to Marduk |
| **Liturgical** | Provides the text for annual Akitu recitation, renewing cosmic and political order |
| **Anthropological** | Explains human purpose — created from defeated rebel's blood to serve the gods |

### 3.2 Humans Created from Blood of a Rebel [4/5 sources]

The creation of humanity carries profound implications:
- Humans are made from **Kingu's blood** — the rebel consort of Tiamat
- This means humanity has both **divine substance** (blood of a god) and **rebellious origin** (blood of the defeated)
- Humans are created for **labor** — to free gods from toil
- This contrasts with Genesis, where humans are made in God's image for relationship
- But parallels Sumerian accounts where humans are created as workers (→ A01, A06)

## 4. CONNECTIONS TO GENESIS AND OTHER TRADITIONS

### 4.1 Enuma Elish and Genesis 1 [5/5 sources]

| Enuma Elish | Genesis 1 | Relationship |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Tiamat (salt water) | *Tehom* ("the deep") — Gen 1:2 | *Tehom* likely derives from *Tiamat* linguistically |
| Creation from splitting Tiamat | Separation of waters above/below (Day 2) | Structural parallel — dividing primordial waters |
| Seven tablets | Seven days of creation | Possible structural echo |
| Divine rest after creation | God rests on Day 7 | Both end with rest/celebration |
| Humans from clay + divine blood | Humans from dust + divine breath | Comparable but theologically distinct |
| Multiple gods in assembly | "Let US make man" (Gen 1:26) — plural | Possible echo of divine council (→ A16) |
| Combat cosmogony | No combat — creation by word | Genesis DELIBERATELY removes combat (de-mythologization) |

### 4.2 The Chaoskampf Pattern [5/5 sources]

The Enuma Elish's central motif — the storm god defeating the chaos dragon — appears throughout the ancient world:

| Tradition | Storm God | Chaos Creature | Source |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| Babylonian | Marduk | Tiamat (dragon) | Enuma Elish |
| Ugaritic | Baal | Yam / Lotan (→ A17) | Baal Cycle |
| Hittite | Teshub | Illuyanka / Hedammu (→ C58) | Hittite myths |
| Israelite | Yahweh | Leviathan / Rahab (→ A02) | Psalms, Job, Isaiah |
| Greek | Zeus | Typhon | Hesiod |
| Norse | Thor | Jörmungandr (→ A12) | Eddas |
| Vedic | Indra | Vritra (→ A20) | Rig Veda |

## 5. THE AKITU FESTIVAL

### 5.1 Annual Re-Enactment [4/5 sources]

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Timing** | Nisannu (first month, spring equinox) — 12-day festival |
| **Day 4** | Enuma Elish recited in its entirety before Marduk's statue |
| **Day 5** | King's humiliation — priest strips king of regalia, slaps his face; king weeps before Marduk |
| **Day 8-10** | Determination of destinies — king "takes Marduk's hand," renewing his right to rule |
| **Day 11** | Sacred marriage (possible — debated) |
| **Purpose** | Annual renewal of cosmic order; king's authority re-legitimated; new year established |
| **Duration** | Attested from Old Babylonian period through Seleucid era (~1800 BCE – 200 BCE) — 1,600+ years |

## 6. COUNTER-ARGUMENTS AND SCHOLARLY DEBATE

| Claim | Supporting Evidence | Counter-Evidence | Assessment |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| Genesis 1 is directly dependent on Enuma Elish | *Tehom/Tiamat* connection; structural parallels; Babylonian exile timing | Differences are equally striking; Genesis may draw on broader Mesopotamian tradition, not specifically Enuma Elish | **Tier 1-2** — influence is likely but relationship is complex (polemic rewriting, not simple borrowing) |
| Enuma Elish was composed to justify Marduk's supremacy | Political context of Marduk's rise in Babylon; Assyrian version substitutes Ashur for Marduk | Earlier Sumerian creation texts don't feature Marduk; text IS political theology | **Tier 1** — scholarly consensus |
| The chaoskampf is a universal mythological pattern | Found independently across Indo-European, Semitic, and even some non-IE cultures | Could represent common ancestry (PIE/PSemitic) rather than independent invention | **Tier 1** — pattern exists widely; transmission vs. independent invention debated |
| Tablet of Destinies = ME (→ A06) | Both represent divine authority governing cosmic functions | ME are Sumerian concept; Tablet of Destinies is Akkadian; not identical but related | **Tier 2** — related concepts in overlapping but distinct tradition streams |
