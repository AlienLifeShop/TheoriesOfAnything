## QUICK SUMMARY

**2 Enoch** (the "Slavonic Apocalypse of Enoch" or "Book of the Secrets of Enoch") and **3 Enoch** (the "Hebrew Apocalypse of Enoch" or "Sefer Hekhalot") are two distinct pseudepigraphical texts that extend the Enochic tradition beyond **1 Enoch** (→ A04). 2 Enoch — surviving only in Old Church Slavonic manuscripts — describes Enoch's ascent through **ten heavens** (compared to 1 Enoch's seven), a unique **creation narrative** spoken by God himself, and a remarkable **Melchizedek birth prophecy**. Its dating is fiercely disputed (proposals range from 1st century BCE to medieval period). 3 Enoch — a Hebrew text of the Hekhalot corpus (→ A22) — describes Rabbi Ishmael's heavenly ascent and his encounter with **Metatron**, who reveals himself as the patriarch Enoch **transformed into the mightiest angel**, bearing **72 names of God** and serving as "the Lesser YHVH." Together, these texts represent the evolution of the Enoch figure from apocalyptic seer (1 Enoch) to cosmic traveler (2 Enoch) to **divine being** (3 Enoch) — one of the most remarkable theological transformations in religious literature.

## 1. VERIFIED CLAIMS (Tier 1 — Peer-Reviewed / Archaeological Record)

### 1.1 2 Enoch — Manuscript Tradition and Structure [5/5 sources]
- Survives in approximately **20 manuscripts** in Old Church Slavonic, the earliest dating to the **14th century CE**
- Exists in two recensions: a **longer** version and a **shorter** version; scholars debate which is more original (Vaillant favored the shorter; Andersen argued for the longer)
- No Greek, Hebrew, or Aramaic original has been found, though most scholars posit a **Greek Vorlage** (source text)
- The text divides into three major sections:
  1. **Enoch's ascent through ten heavens** (chapters 1–21)
  2. **God's revelation of creation** (chapters 22–38)
  3. **Enoch's return and moral instructions** (chapters 39–68)

### 1.2 2 Enoch — The Ten Heavens [5/5 sources]

| Heaven | Content | Notable Features |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **1st** | Rulers of stellar orders; storehouse of snow, dew, and clouds | Angels governing celestial administration |
| **2nd** | Prison of **fallen angels** — dark, in torment | Awaiting eternal judgment; parallels 1 Enoch's imprisoned Watchers |
| **3rd** | **Paradise** (Garden of Eden) in the north; place of punishment in the south | The righteous dead dwell here; paradise is **not on Earth** but in the third heaven (cf. 2 Corinthians 12:2) |
| **4th** | Sun and moon courses; detailed astronomical mechanisms | Elaborate solar chariot; phoenixes and chalkydri pull the sun |
| **5th** | **Grigori** (Watchers) — some fallen, some mourning their brethren's descent | Enoch encourages them to resume liturgical service |
| **6th** | Seven bands of **archangels** governing cosmic order | Record-keeping angels; rulers of nature and nations |
| **7th** | God's **throne**; highest angelic orders (Seraphim, Cherubim, Ophanim) | Enoch sees "the Lord's face — like iron made burning hot… terrible and frightful" |
| **8th** | Called **Muzaloth** — the "changer of seasons" | Zodiacal governance; cosmic calendar |
| **9th** | Called **Kuchavim** — heavenly homes of the twelve zodiac signs | Stellar architecture |
| **10th** | God's **face** revealed directly; Enoch stands before the divine throne | God commands archangel Michael to clothe Enoch in garments of glory |

- This **ten-heaven scheme** is unique to 2 Enoch — 1 Enoch describes seven heavens, and the Hekhalot literature (→ A22) typically uses seven palaces
- The ten-heaven system has possible parallels in some Gnostic texts and in Paul's ambiguous "third heaven" reference

### 1.3 3 Enoch — Identification and Status [5/5 sources]
- A Hebrew text belonging to the **Hekhalot corpus** (→ A22), also known as **Sefer Hekhalot** ("Book of Palaces")
- Philip Alexander's critical edition (1983) in Charlesworth's *Old Testament Pseudepigrapha* is the standard scholarly text
- Dated to approximately the **5th–6th century CE**, though some elements may be earlier
- Framed as Rabbi Ishmael's ascent to the seventh heaven (seventh palace), where he encounters Metatron

### 1.4 3 Enoch — The Metatron Revelation [5/5 sources]
- Metatron identifies himself to Rabbi Ishmael: **"I am Enoch ben Jared"** (3 Enoch 4:2)
- He recounts his **transformation**: God took him from the generation of the Flood, carried him on the wings of the Shekhinah to the highest heaven, and transformed his flesh into fire
- His body was enlarged to cosmic scale — **"equal in length and width to the length and width of the world"** (3 Enoch 9:2)
- He was given **72 wings** (36 pairs) and **365,000 eyes** — each eye "like the Great Light" (the sun)
- God placed on him a **crown** engraved with the letters by which heaven, earth, seas, and all creation were made
- He was given the title **"the Lesser YHVH"** (3 Enoch 12:5) — provoking the objection of other angels: "Are there then two powers in heaven?" (the *shtei reshuyot* controversy)

## 2. CREDIBLE CLAIMS (Tier 2 — Academic / Debated but Supported)

### 2.1 2 Enoch's Creation Narrative — A Unique Cosmogony [4/5 sources]
- In chapters 24–30, God narrates creation directly to Enoch — a feature **unique among Jewish pseudepigrapha**
- God commands a visible being called **Adoil** ("God's eternity" or "light of God") to come forth from the invisible: "And Adoil descended and became great, and his belly was a great light"
- From Adoil's disintegration, all **visible creation** pours forth — this is a **creatio ex nihilo** narrative that may represent one of the **earliest Jewish formulations** of creation from nothing
- A second primordial being, **Archas** (darkness/solidity), emerges to form the lower foundations
- This cosmogony differs significantly from Genesis and from the Enuma Elish (→ A18), presenting creation as divine **verbal command** producing primordial light-beings who then differentiate

### 2.2 2 Enoch's Ethical Instructions — Enoch's Return to Earth [3/5 sources]
- After receiving the creation revelation, Enoch is returned to Earth for **30 days** to transmit his knowledge to his sons
- Chapters 39–66 contain extensive **moral instructions**: care for the poor, just treatment of animals, the cosmic consequences of human action
- 2 Enoch 30:15: "I created man from invisible and from visible nature; of both are his death and life and image" — an anthropology combining spiritual and material elements
- The text emphasizes that human actions have **cosmic consequences** — righteousness sustains creation, while wickedness damages the cosmic order
- This ethical cosmology parallels the Zoroastrian concept of **asha** (cosmic truth maintained by righteous action, → A26) and the Egyptian concept of **Ma'at**

### 2.3 2 Enoch's Melchizedek Prophecy [4/5 sources]
- Chapters 69–73 (longer recension) describe the **miraculous birth of Melchizedek** to Nir (Noah's brother) and his wife Sopanima, who dies before giving birth
- The child emerges from the deceased Sopanima **fully formed**, bearing the **"badge of priesthood"** on his chest, and speaking blessings
- God sends the archangel Michael to take Melchizedek to **Paradise** (3rd heaven) to preserve him through the coming Flood, establishing him as **eternal priest**
- This connects to the enigmatic Melchizedek of Genesis 14 and Psalm 110 ("priest forever after the order of Melchizedek") and to the **Dead Sea Scrolls' 11QMelchizedek** fragment, which portrays Melchizedek as a heavenly being
- Hebrews 7:3 describes Melchizedek as "without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life" — 2 Enoch provides a narrative explaining this theology

### 2.4 3 Enoch — The Cosmic Curtain (Pargod) and 72 Names [3/5 sources]
- 3 Enoch describes the **Pargod** (cosmic curtain/veil) hanging before the divine throne, on which are depicted all events of history — past and future
- Metatron is granted knowledge of the Pargod and serves as its custodian — giving him **omniscience** regarding the historical process
- The **72 names of Metatron** (3 Enoch 48D) correspond to 72 names of God — a concept that became central in later Kabbalah (→ N09, A22) and in magical traditions
- The numerical significance of 72 appears across traditions: 72 disciples of Jesus (Luke 10), 72 translators of the Septuagint, 72 names in the Shemhamphorash

### 2.5 Angelic Hierarchies Across the Three Enochs [4/5 sources]

| Category | 1 Enoch | 2 Enoch | 3 Enoch |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Heaven levels** | 7 | 10 | 7 (palaces) |
| **Highest angels** | Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel | Same + Pravuil (recording angel) | Metatron above all; Michael and Gabriel serve beneath him |
| **Fallen angels** | 200 Watchers descend Mount Hermon | Grigori imprisoned in 2nd heaven; some in 5th heaven mourn | The "Princes" cast down in 3 Enoch 26 |
| **Divine encounter** | Enoch sees the "Great Glory" on a crystal throne | Enoch sees God's face "like iron made burning" | Ishmael sees the "throne of glory" via Metatron |
| **Enoch's status** | Prophet and scribe; heavenly tour guide | Transformed: "God set me on his left with Gabriel" | **Metatron** — "the Lesser YHVH," cosmic ruler |

### 2.4 The Dating Controversy of 2 Enoch [3/5 sources]
- **Early dating** (1st c. BCE – 1st c. CE): supported by parallels with Philo, absence of clear Christian elements, and affinity with Second Temple period thought (Andersen, Böttrich)
- **Late dating** (9th–10th c. CE or later): argued by some scholars (Vaillant, Milik) based on possible Bogomil influence and the absence of any pre-Slavonic manuscript
- **Mediating position** (Orlov, 2005): the core text may be early (1st c. CE) but underwent significant **medieval Slavonic expansion**
- The absence of any Greek, Hebrew, or Aramaic fragment — in contrast to 1 Enoch's abundant Dead Sea Scrolls evidence — makes the dating question genuinely unresolvable with current evidence

## 3. SPECULATIVE CLAIMS (Tier 3 — Possible but Unverified)

### 3.1 The Enoch-Metatron Transformation as Apotheosis Tradition [3/5 sources]
- The trajectory from 1 Enoch (human prophet elevated) through 2 Enoch (transformed and glorified) to 3 Enoch (fully divine — "Lesser YHVH") traces a progressive **deification of a human figure** — what scholars call an **apotheosis tradition**
- This parallels the transformation of other figures in antiquity: **Elijah** (translated to heaven), **Moses** (given a luminous face; in some traditions enthroned in heaven), and potentially **Jesus** (human → divine in early Christology)
- Andrei Orlov has argued that the Metatron tradition represents a **suppressed theological option** within Judaism — the possibility of human-divine transformation — that was marginalized precisely because of its closeness to Christian claims about Jesus
- Whether this suppression shaped early Jewish-Christian boundaries remains debated

### 3.2 2 Enoch's Ten Heavens and Sefirotic Structure [2/5 sources]
- Some scholars have noted structural parallels between 2 Enoch's **ten heavens** and the later Kabbalistic **ten Sefirot** (→ A22)
- Both describe a tenfold hierarchy of divine reality, with the highest level being the direct presence of God
- Whether there is any historical connection (2 Enoch influencing Sefer Yetzirah or early Kabbalah through channels now lost) or merely structural coincidence remains unknown

### 3.3 The Grigori of the Fifth Heaven as a Distinct Tradition [2/5 sources]
- In 2 Enoch, the Grigori (Watchers) of the 5th heaven are **not imprisoned** — they are mourning their fallen brothers and have ceased singing the liturgy
- Enoch **encourages them to resume** their worship — a redemptive moment absent from 1 Enoch, where fallen Watchers receive only condemnation
- This may preserve an **alternate Watcher tradition** in which the angels' sin admitted degrees of participation — some fell fully, some merely mourned and withdrew

---

## 4. DUBIOUS CLAIMS (Tier 4 — No Credible Source / Contradicted by Evidence)

### 4.1 2 Enoch Was Written by the Historical Enoch
- As with 1 Enoch, the text is pseudepigraphical — attributed to a legendary antediluvian figure as a literary device, not composed by an actual person named Enoch

### 4.2 Metatron Was a "Real" Angelic Being Revealed through Genuine Mystical Contact
- While the Hekhalot practitioners may have had genuine altered-state experiences, the Metatron figure shows clear signs of **theological construction** — his attributes accumulate across texts over centuries, reflecting changing ideas about angelic power rather than consistent testimony about a single entity

### 4.3 The Ten-Heaven Scheme Reflects Literal Cosmological Knowledge
- The expansion from seven to ten heavens represents theological elaboration, not astronomical observation; no ancient astronomical system corresponds to a ten-tier vertical cosmology

## NOTES ON METHODOLOGY
- 2 Enoch's dating remains one of the most contested issues in pseudepigrapha studies; this document presents all major positions without privileging any single dating hypothesis
- The absence of pre-Slavonic manuscripts for 2 Enoch means all textual conclusions must be treated with greater caution than for 1 Enoch (which has Qumran Aramaic evidence)
- 3 Enoch is securely placed within the Hekhalot corpus; for its literary context alongside other Hekhalot texts, see [A22](A22_Zohar_Merkabah_Hekhalot.md)
- The Enoch-Metatron transformation trajectory (1 Enoch → 2 Enoch → 3 Enoch) is a scholarly construct reflecting textual history, not a linear developmental claim about a single tradition
