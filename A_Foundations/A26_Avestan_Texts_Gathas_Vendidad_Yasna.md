## QUICK SUMMARY

The **Avesta** is the primary scripture of **Zoroastrianism**, the religion founded by the prophet **Zarathushtra** (Greek: Zoroaster) in ancient Iran. The surviving Avesta — a fraction of a much larger corpus reportedly destroyed during Alexander's conquest — includes three major textual layers: the **Gathas** (Old Avestan hymns composed by Zarathushtra himself, ~1500–1000 BCE), the **Yasna** (liturgical texts including the Gathas and the archaic Yasna Haptanghaiti), and the **Vendidad** (Young Avestan laws against demons and impurity). These texts articulate the foundational **cosmic dualism** between **Ahura Mazda** (Wise Lord) and **Angra Mainyu** (Destructive Spirit), introduce the **Amesha Spentas** (seven divine emanations), and describe eschatological concepts — the **Chinvat Bridge** of judgment, bodily resurrection, and the future **Saoshyant** (savior) — that profoundly influenced Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The Avestan language shares a common ancestor with Vedic Sanskrit, and the systematic deva/daeva reversal between the two traditions represents one of the most significant theological divergences in Indo-Iranian religious history.

## 1. VERIFIED CLAIMS (Tier 1 — Peer-Reviewed / Archaeological Record)

### 1.1 The Avesta — Structure and Survival [5/5 sources]
- The surviving Avesta represents perhaps **one-quarter** of the original corpus; Zoroastrian tradition holds that the full texts were written on 12,000 cowhides and destroyed when Alexander burned Persepolis (330 BCE)
- The texts were transmitted **orally** for centuries, not committed to writing until the Sasanian period (3rd–7th c. CE), when the **Avestan alphabet** (Din Dabireh) was created specifically for this purpose
- The oldest extant manuscript dates to **1288 CE** — later than any other major religious scripture's manuscript tradition

| Division | Language | Content | Approx. Date |
|----------|----------|---------|---------------|
| **Gathas** (5 hymns, 17 chapters) | Old Avestan | Zarathushtra's own compositions; theological core | ~1500–1000 BCE (debated) |
| **Yasna Haptanghaiti** (Y. 35–41) | Old Avestan | Seven-chapter liturgy of worship; prose | Contemporary with or slightly after Gathas |
| **Yasna** (72 chapters total) | Old + Young Avestan | Full liturgical service; contains Gathas | Core: ~1500–500 BCE |
| **Vendidad** (Videvdad, 22 chapters) | Young Avestan | Laws against demons; purity code; mythological narratives | ~6th–4th c. BCE |
| **Visperad** (24 chapters) | Young Avestan | Supplements to Yasna liturgy; festival prayers | ~6th–4th c. BCE |
| **Yashts** (21 hymns) | Young Avestan | Hymns to individual divine beings (yazatas) | ~6th–4th c. BCE |
| **Khordeh Avesta** | Young Avestan + later | Daily prayers; Nyayeshes and Gahs | Various, some late |

### 1.2 The Gathas — Zarathushtra's Own Words [5/5 sources]
- The Gathas consist of **five hymns** (ha, plural gathas) with a total of **238 stanzas** embedded within the Yasna (Y. 28–34, 43–51, 53):

| Gatha | Yasna Chapters | Name | Stanzas | Meter |
|-------|---------------|------|---------|-------|
| **Ahunavaiti** | Y. 28–34 | "Possessing Ahuna" | 100 | 7+9 syllables |
| **Ushtavaiti** | Y. 43–46 | "Possessing Happiness" | 66 | 4+7 syllables |
| **Spenta Mainyu** | Y. 47–50 | "Bounteous Spirit" | 41 | 4+7 syllables |
| **Vohu Khshathra** | Y. 51 | "Good Dominion" | 22 | 7+7 syllables |
| **Vahishtoishti** | Y. 53 | "Best Desire" | 9 | 2-line stanzas |

- Written in **Old Avestan**, a language so archaic it is virtually interchangeable grammatically with Rig Vedic Sanskrit — they are "two dialects of a single language" (Skjærvø)
- The Gathas are addressed directly to **Ahura Mazda** and employ first-person speech — Zarathushtra describes his vision, his struggles with opponents, and his plea for divine guidance
- Scholarly consensus: these are **genuine compositions** of a single prophetic figure, not pseudepigraphical compilations

### 1.3 Zarathushtra — Dating and Historicity [5/5 sources]
- **Traditional Zoroastrian date:** "258 years before Alexander" = ~588 BCE (but this refers to a legendary calculation)
- **Linguistic dating:** the closeness of Old Avestan to Rig Vedic Sanskrit suggests a date of **~1500–1200 BCE** or possibly ~1000 BCE (Boyce, Gnoli, Skjærvø)
- **Archaeological context:** the pastoral-nomadic society described in the Gathas (cattle-herding, no cities or empires mentioned) fits an **Inner Asian/Central Asian** setting before the rise of the Persian empires
- Gnoli and others have proposed **eastern Iran / Central Asia** (Bactria, Margiana, Sogdiana) as Zarathushtra's homeland
- Mary Boyce's dating (~1500–1200 BCE) is widely adopted; the earlier date makes Zarathushtra roughly **contemporary with the Rig Vedic period**

## 2. CREDIBLE CLAIMS (Tier 2 — Academic / Debated but Supported)

### 2.1 The Deva/Daeva Reversal — Indo-Iranian Theological Schism [4/5 sources]

| Feature | Vedic (Indian) | Avestan (Iranian) |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **"Shining ones"** | *deva* — GODS (positive, worshipped) | *daeva* — DEMONS (rejected, opposed) |
| **"Lords"** | *asura* — ambiguous; sometimes anti-gods | *ahura* — GOD (Ahura Mazda = supreme deity) |
| **Supreme deity** | Indra (storm god, among many) | Ahura Mazda (Wise Lord, supreme) |
| **Indra's role** | King of gods, heroic slayer of Vritra | Listed as a **daeva** in Vendidad 10.9 |
| **Fire deity** | Agni — god of fire and sacrifice | Atar — sacred fire, son of Ahura Mazda |
| **Sacred drink** | Soma (divine plant) | Haoma (cognate ritual plant) |
| **Cosmic order** | Rta (cosmic law/truth) | Asha (truth/righteousness — cognate term) |

- This systematic reversal suggests a **deliberate theological revolution**: Zarathushtra rejected the worship of the Indo-Iranian deva class, elevating the ahura class (particularly Ahura Mazda) and demonizing the devas
- The reversal is not total — some deities (Mitra/Mithra, Vayu) retain positive status in both traditions
- This represents one of the most significant **religious schisms** in the ancient world, predating the Abrahamic monotheistic revolutions (→ C56)

### 2.2 The Seven Amesha Spentas ("Holy Immortals") [4/5 sources]

| Amesha Spenta | Meaning | Domain | Vedic Parallel |
|--------------|---------|--------|---------------|
| **Vohu Manah** | Good Mind | Cattle, righteous thought | — |
| **Asha Vahishta** | Best Truth/Righteousness | Fire, cosmic order | Rta (Vedic cosmic law) |
| **Khshathra Vairya** | Desirable Dominion | Metals, just rule | — |
| **Spenta Armaiti** | Holy Devotion | Earth, piety | Aramati (Vedic devotion) |
| **Haurvatat** | Wholeness/Health | Water, completeness | — |
| **Ameretat** | Immortality | Plants, eternal life | Amrita (Vedic immortality) |
| **Spenta Mainyu** | Bounteous Spirit | Ahura Mazda's creative aspect | — |

- In the Gathas, these may be **abstract qualities of Ahura Mazda**; in the Young Avesta, they become more distinctly **personified divine beings** — a process analogous to the development from abstract concepts to angels in Judeo-Christian tradition
- Scholarly comparison: the Amesha Spentas have been likened to the **Kabbalistic Sefirot** (→ A22), the **Neoplatonic emanations**, and the **Archangels** of Abrahamic tradition (→ B14)

### 2.3 The Vendidad — Anti-Demonic Law [4/5 sources]
- Full title: *Videvdad* ("Law Against the Daevas") — the only Avestan text surviving in its entirety
- Organized as a dialogue between Zarathushtra and Ahura Mazda
- **Chapter 1** lists 16 perfect lands created by Ahura Mazda, each afflicted by a counter-creation of Angra Mainyu — a "geography of good vs. evil" that has been used to reconstruct the **homeland** of the Avestan people
- **Chapter 2** contains the **Yima narrative** (cognate with Vedic Yama): Yima builds an underground **vara** (enclosure) to preserve humans, animals, plants, and seeds from a coming catastrophic winter — a striking parallel to the **Flood/cataclysm preservation** narrative (→ A04, E01)
- Purity laws dominate much of the text — elaborate regulations about contact with corpses (nasu), types of pollution, and purification techniques

### 2.4 Eschatological Concepts — Chinvat Bridge, Resurrection, Saoshyant [4/5 sources]
- **Chinvat Bridge** (Bridge of the Requiter): at death, the soul crosses a bridge; for the righteous, it is wide and easy; for the wicked, it becomes razor-thin and they fall into the abyss
- **Frashokereti** (Making Wonderful): the final renovation of the world, when evil is permanently defeated, the dead are resurrected in physical bodies, and the world is made perfect
- **Saoshyant** (Savior): a future figure born of Zarathushtra's seed (preserved miraculously in a lake) who will lead the final battle against evil
- These concepts are widely argued to have **influenced Second Temple Judaism** (Pharisaic resurrection belief, the Messiah concept, the Last Judgment) and subsequently Christianity and Islam
- The direction of influence is debated, but the **chronological priority** of the Zoroastrian formulations (if the earlier dating of Zarathushtra is accepted) is acknowledged by most scholars (Boyce, Duchesne-Guillemin, Zaehner)

## 3. SPECULATIVE CLAIMS (Tier 3 — Possible but Unverified)

### 3.1 Zoroastrian Influence on Abrahamic Monotheism [3/5 sources]
- The hypothesis that Judaism adopted **monotheism, angelology, demonology, resurrection, final judgment, and messianism** from Zoroastrianism during and after the Babylonian Exile (586–538 BCE) is longstanding (first proposed by scholars in the 19th century)
- **Supporting evidence:** these concepts appear in Judaism primarily in **post-exilic** texts; the Persian emperor Cyrus the Great is called God's "anointed" (mashiach) in Isaiah 45:1; the Magi appear at Jesus's birth (Matthew 2)
- **Counter-arguments:** some of these concepts have indigenous Israelite antecedents; the direction of influence may have been mutual; late literary attestation does not prove late development
- The question remains one of the **great unresolved problems** in the history of religions

### 3.2 Haoma/Soma as Entheogenic Practice [3/5 sources]
- Avestan *haoma* is cognate with Vedic *soma* — both describe a sacred plant pressed for ritual juice
- R. Gordon Wasson (1968) proposed soma/haoma was **Amanita muscaria** (fly agaric mushroom); David Flattery and Martin Schwartz (1989) proposed **Ephedra** or **Peganum harmala** (Syrian rue, containing harmaline)
- The Yasna haoma ceremony remains a living practice in Zoroastrian ritual using **ephedra twigs** — though modern practitioners do not consider it entheogenic
- Whether the original haoma had **psychoactive properties** conducive to visionary experience remains unresolved

### 3.3 Yima's Vara as Catastrophe Preservation Technology [2/5 sources]
- The vara (enclosure) of Yima, containing seeds, animals, and select humans, surviving a catastrophic winter sent by Angra Mainyu, has been compared to: **Noah's Ark**, the **Svalbard Global Seed Vault**, and genetic preservation programs
- Some speculative interpretations suggest the narrative preserves memory of a **real catastrophic event** (possibly the Younger Dryas cold period, ~12,800 BP) and an organized survival effort
- No archaeological evidence supports identification of a physical vara; the narrative is most likely a **mythological motif** shared with flood/catastrophe traditions worldwide

---

## 4. DUBIOUS CLAIMS (Tier 4 — No Credible Source / Contradicted by Evidence)

### 4.1 Zarathushtra Had Contact with Extraterrestrial Beings
- Popular claims that Ahura Mazda was an alien entity communicating with Zarathushtra have no textual or archaeological support; the Gathas describe a prophetic revelatory experience consistent with other ancient Near Eastern prophetic traditions

### 4.2 The Full Avesta Contained Advanced Scientific Knowledge
- Claims that the "lost" portions of the Avesta contained encoded medical, astronomical, or technological knowledge beyond what the surviving texts show are speculative and unfalsifiable
