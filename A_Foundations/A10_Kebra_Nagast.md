## QUICK SUMMARY

The Kebra Nagast ("Glory of Kings") is a 14th-century CE Ethiopian text — written in Ge'ez, the classical Ethiopian liturgical language — that serves as the foundation myth of the Solomonic dynasty of Ethiopia and the spiritual charter of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. It narrates how the Queen of Sheba (identified as Makeda, Queen of Ethiopia) visited King Solomon in Jerusalem, conceived a son named Menelik I, and how this son later traveled to Jerusalem, met his father, and upon returning to Ethiopia, brought the Ark of the Covenant with him to Aksum — where Ethiopian tradition maintains it remains to this day, guarded in the Chapel of the Tablet at the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion by a single monk (the Guardian of the Ark) who never leaves the chapel and is the only person permitted to see it. This is not simply a legend — it is a LIVING religious tradition: the Ethiopian Orthodox Church (one of the oldest Christian churches, established ~4th century CE) holds the Ark claim as a central article of faith, and every Ethiopian church contains a replica (tabot) of the Tablets of the Law. The Solomonic dynasty ruled Ethiopia from 1270 to 1974, when Haile Selassie (who claimed to be the 225th descendant of Menelik I) was deposed. The text raises extraordinary questions: Is there ANY historical basis for the Solomon-Sheba connection? What was the kingdom of Sheba? Could the Ark of the Covenant — the most sought artifact in Biblical archaeology — actually be in Aksum? And why does an African kingdom claim to hold the central relic of Israelite religion?

## 1. VERIFIED CLAIMS (Tier 1 — Historical and Textual Data)

### 1.1 The Text Itself [5/5 sources]
- **Composition:** the surviving text was compiled ~1314-1322 CE during the reign of Amda Seyon I (1314-1344), the first great emperor of the restored Solomonic dynasty
  - **Translator/compiler:** Yetbarek (Nebura'ed of Aksum) — reportedly from an Arabic source, which itself claimed to derive from a Coptic (i.e., Egyptian Christian) source
  - **Language:** classical Ge'ez (Ethiopic), a Semitic language related to ancient South Arabian
  - **Structure:** 117 chapters, combining narrative, prophecy, genealogy, and theological argument
- **Primary purpose:** to LEGITIMIZE the Solomonic dynasty by establishing:
  1. Ethiopia's divine election as the "New Israel"
  2. The transfer of the Ark of the Covenant from Jerusalem to Aksum
  3. The direct bloodline from Solomon → Menelik I → Ethiopian emperors
  4. Ethiopia's replacement of Israel as God's chosen nation
- **Political context:** written just after the Solomonic dynasty displaced the Zagwe dynasty (1137-1270). The text provided ideological justification for the new dynasty's divine right to rule — classic political use of sacred narrative (see C17)

### 1.2 The Narrative Summary [5/5 sources]
- **Part I — Makeda and Solomon:**
  - Makeda, Queen of Sheba (Ethiopia), hears of Solomon's wisdom → travels to Jerusalem → impressed by his wisdom, converts from sun worship to worship of the God of Israel
  - Solomon desires her → tricks her into sleeping with him (she agreed not to take anything from his house without permission; he served her spicy food and placed water by the bed; when she drank the water in the night, he said she had taken something from him, voiding her vow of chastity)
  - She returns to Ethiopia pregnant → gives birth to Menelik I (also called Bayna-Lehkem / Ibn al-Hakim — "Son of the Wise")
- **Part II — Menelik and the Ark:**
  - At age 22, Menelik travels to Jerusalem to meet Solomon
  - Solomon anoints Menelik king of Ethiopia
  - Menelik's companions (sons of Israelite elders) steal the Ark of the Covenant → replace it with a replica
  - They bring the Ark to Ethiopia (the land of "Zion")
  - When Solomon discovers the theft, he is devastated but accepts it as God's will — the glory has passed from Israel to Ethiopia
- **Part III — Theological Framework:**
  - Ethiopia is the "New Zion" — God's covenant has been transferred from Israel to Ethiopia
  - The Ethiopian kings are the legitimate successors to David's throne
  - This narrative is NOT sequential history but a theological argument using narrative form

### 1.3 The Historical Queen of Sheba [4/5 sources]
- **Biblical reference:** 1 Kings 10:1-13 and 2 Chronicles 9:1-12 record the Queen of Sheba visiting Solomon, but give NO name and provide limited detail
  - She arrives with "a great caravan — with camels carrying spices, large quantities of gold, and precious stones"
  - Tests Solomon with "hard questions" (riddles)
  - Gives him 120 talents of gold, spices, and precious stones
  - Solomon gives her "all she desired and asked for" — the Hebrew is ambiguous (sexual connotation possible)
- **Location of "Sheba" — debated:**
  - **South Arabian Sheba (Saba):** the Sabaean kingdom in modern Yemen — the strongest candidate based on linguistics (Sheba/Saba), archaeological evidence (wealthy incense trade kingdom, 8th-2nd centuries BCE), and inscription evidence
  - **Ethiopian Sheba:** Ethiopian tradition identifies Sheba with the ancient Ethiopian state of D'mt (which DID have cultural connections with South Arabia — shared Semitic languages, monumental architecture, similar script)
  - **The two are NOT mutually exclusive:** the Red Sea is narrow at the Strait of Mandeb (Bab-el-Mandeb, ~30 km); South Arabian and Ethiopian/Eritrean cultures were interconnected, and the same queen could theoretically have ruled territories on both sides
- **Archaeological evidence:**
  - The Sabaean kingdom in Yemen is well-attested (Ma'rib dam, inscriptions, temples)
  - The Ethiopian kingdom of D'mt (10th-5th century BCE) shows South Arabian cultural influence but is independently attested
  - **NO inscription or archaeological evidence names the Queen of Sheba** — her historicity is possible but unproven

### 1.4 The Solomonic Dynasty [4/5 sources]
- **Claimed lineage:** Solomon → Menelik I → ... → Haile Selassie (225th in the line)
  - The Zagwe dynasty (1137-1270) was considered illegitimate because they lacked Solomonic descent
  - Yekuno Amlak (r. 1270-1285) claimed Solomonic lineage through Menelik I → established the dynasty that ruled until 1974
  - **Haile Selassie (r. 1930-1974):** the last emperor, styled himself "Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah, Elect of God, and King of Kings of Ethiopia"
- **Historical assessment:**
  - The 225-generation genealogy is almost certainly a political-religious construction, not a literal family tree
  - However, Ethiopian civilization IS ancient (Aksumite kingdom, 1st-7th century CE, was a major power; earlier D'mt kingdom from ~10th century BCE)
  - Cultural connections between Ethiopia and the Near East (including Judaic practices in Ethiopian peoples like the Beta Israel/Falasha) are REAL, even if the specific Solomonic genealogy is legendary

### 1.5 The Ark of the Covenant Claim [4/5 sources]
- **Ethiopian tradition asserts the Ark is in the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion, Aksum:**
  - Guarded by a single monk (Guardian of the Ark) appointed for life
  - The Guardian never leaves the chapel
  - NO ONE except the Guardian is permitted to see the Ark — not bishops, not the Patriarch, not the Emperor (when the monarchy existed)
  - Every Ethiopian Orthodox church contains a **tabot** — a replica of the Tablets of the Law, kept in the Holy of Holies (maqdas) and central to the liturgy
- **Is the Ark really there?**
  - **No independent verification exists.** No outsider has been permitted to examine the object.
  - The refusal to allow examination is consistent either with (a) genuine belief in the Ark's sacred inviolability, or (b) the absence of what they claim to possess
  - **Graham Hancock's *The Sign and the Seal* (1992):** popular account arguing the Ethiopian claim is plausible based on textual, historical, and architectural analysis. Widely read but not considered scholarly.
  - **Edward Ullendorff (1968):** noted Ethiopicist who claimed he saw the Ark as a British officer in 1941 during the Italian occupation — he described it as a "wooden slab" and said it was clearly a medieval construction. Ethiopian clergy dispute his account.

## 2. CREDIBLE CLAIMS (Tier 2 — Historical Analysis)

### 2.1 Judaic Practices in Ethiopia [3/5 sources]
- **The Beta Israel (Ethiopian Jews):**
  - Community of Ethiopian Jews who practiced a form of Judaism that included animal sacrifice, ritual purity laws, and Sabbath observance — but did NOT have the Talmud (suggesting separation from mainstream Judaism BEFORE the Talmudic period, i.e., before ~200 CE)
  - DNA studies show the Beta Israel are genetically similar to other Ethiopian populations — suggesting local conversion rather than descent from Israelite migrants (though this remains debated)
  - ~85,000 Beta Israel were airlifted to Israel in Operation Moses (1984) and Operation Solomon (1991)
- **Broader Judaic practices in Ethiopian Christianity:**
  - Dietary laws similar to Levitical kosher rules
  - Circumcision on the 8th day
  - Saturday AND Sunday Sabbath observance
  - The Ark/tabot tradition
  - **These practices suggest genuine ancient connections** between Ethiopia and Israelite religious traditions, regardless of whether the Kebra Nagast's specific narrative is historically accurate

### 2.2 The Text as Political Theology [3/5 sources]
- **The Kebra Nagast functions identically to other founding myths:**
  - Roman: Aeneid links Rome to Troy → divine destiny
  - Japanese: Kojiki links emperors to Amaterasu → divine lineage
  - British: Geoffrey of Monmouth links British kings to Troy → Brutus
  - **Ethiopian:** Kebra Nagast links emperors to Solomon → divinely chosen nation
- **The transfer-of-divine-favor motif** (Israel → Ethiopia) parallels:
  - Translatio imperii (transfer of empire) in medieval European thought: Rome → Byzantium → Holy Roman Empire
  - Islamic supersessionism: Islam as the final, corrected revelation after Judaism and Christianity
  - **Each narrative serves to legitimize the current ruling class by establishing a divine genealogy and a cosmic destiny**

## 3. SPECULATIVE CLAIMS (Tier 3 — Alternative Interpretations)

### 3.1 Could the Ark Claim Have a Historical Kernel? [2/5 sources]
- **Several scenarios have been proposed:**
  - The original Ark (or a very early copy) was taken from Jerusalem during the Babylonian destruction (586 BCE) → transported via Egypt to Ethiopia (the Egyptian connection is plausible given the Elephantine Jewish community on the Nile, documented 5th century BCE)
  - The Ark was taken during the period of instability in Judah under wicked kings (2 Kings 21-23); the Temple was plundered multiple times before Babylon
  - Ethiopian trading connections with ancient Israel are plausible (the incense trade route connected South Arabia to the Mediterranean via the Levant)
- **The literary transmission:** Arabic → Coptic → Ge'ez suggests the narrative traveled through Egypt — consistent with the claim that the Ark traveled through Egypt to Ethiopia

### 3.2 Rastafari and the Kebra Nagast [2/5 sources]
- **The Rastafari movement (1930s, Jamaica) adopted the Kebra Nagast as a central scripture:**
  - Haile Selassie is considered the returned Messiah (Jah Rastafari)
  - Ethiopia is the promised land (Zion); the West is "Babylon"
  - The Solomonic genealogy of Haile Selassie → connection to King David → messianic lineage
  - **This reinterpretation gave the Kebra Nagast global significance** beyond Ethiopian religious tradition

---

## 4. DUBIOUS CLAIMS (Tier 4 — Unsupported)

### 4.1 "The Kebra Nagast Proves Ethiopian Possession of the Biblical Ark" [3/5 sources]
- **[UNVERIFIED]** The text is a 14th-century political-theological document with clear ideological purpose. While it may encode genuine historical memories, it cannot be used as EVIDENCE for the current possession of the Ark. Without independent verification of the object in Aksum, the claim remains a matter of faith, not history.

### 4.2 "The Queen of Sheba Was Ethiopian, Not Arabian" [2/5 sources]
- **[OVERSIMPLIFIED]** The Queen of Sheba's historicity is itself uncertain. The strongest archaeological evidence for the kingdom of "Sheba/Saba" points to South Arabia (Yemen), but the cultural interconnection between South Arabia and Ethiopia means the distinction may be anachronistic.
