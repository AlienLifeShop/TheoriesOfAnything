## QUICK SUMMARY

The **Quran** — Islam's primary sacred text (610–632 CE) — presents a rich cosmological framework that includes **seven heavens** and seven earths, a **Throne of God** (al-Arsh) upon the cosmic waters, a fully populated invisible realm of **jinn** (beings of smokeless fire → B04), an elaborate **angelic hierarchy** (malā'ika), and one of the most detailed **eschatological programs** in any religious text. What makes the Quranic cosmology distinctive is its emphasis on **divine unity** (tawhid): unlike the Enuma Elish (→ A18) or Vedic hymns (→ A20), there is no cosmic battle, no divine genealogy, no primordial chaos — creation occurs by **divine command** ("Be!" — *Kun fa-yakūn*). Yet the Quran incorporates and transforms elements from earlier Abrahamic and Near Eastern traditions: **Iblis** (the jinn who refused to bow to Adam) parallels the fallen angel tradition (→ A04); the **seven heavens** echo Mesopotamian cosmology (→ C20); the **Isra and Mi'raj** (Night Journey) traverses a cosmic geography reminiscent of merkabah mysticism. Islamic scholarship developed extraordinary commentary traditions (tafsir), while **Sufi mystics** (→ C57) interpreted these cosmological elements as maps of **inner spiritual geography** — the seven heavens as stations of the soul's ascent toward divine union.

## 1. QURANIC COSMOLOGICAL STRUCTURE

### 1.1 The Seven Heavens and Seven Earths [5/5 sources]

| Level | Quranic Reference | Content |
|-------|-------------------|---------|
| **Seven heavens** | Q 2:29, 67:3, 71:15 | Created in layers; each with its own function and angelic inhabitants |
| **Seven earths** | Q 65:12 | "Allah is He who created seven heavens and of the earth the like thereof" |
| **Lowest heaven** | Q 37:6, 67:5 | Adorned with stars (kawākib); guarded by shooting stars against eavesdropping jinn |
| **The Throne (al-Arsh)** | Q 7:54, 11:7 | "His Throne was upon the water" — before creation of heavens and earth |
| **The Footstool (al-Kursi)** | Q 2:255 (Ayat al-Kursi) | "His Kursi extends over the heavens and the earth" — often distinct from Throne |
| **The Preserved Tablet (Lawh al-Mahfuz)** | Q 85:21-22 | All events pre-recorded — connects to divine foreknowledge and destiny |
| **The Lote Tree (Sidrat al-Muntaha)** | Q 53:14-16 | The boundary-tree at the edge of the seventh heaven, beyond which no creature passes |

### 1.2 Creation by Command [4/5 sources]

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Mechanism** | *Kun fa-yakūn* — "Be! And it is" (Q 2:117, 36:82) — creation by divine word/command |
| **Duration** | Six "days" (*ayyam*) — Islamic scholarship debates whether these are literal or epochs |
| **No combat** | Unlike Babylonian (→ A18) or Ugaritic (→ A17) cosmogony, no primordial battle |
| **Ex nihilo** | Generally interpreted as creation from nothing, though Q 11:7 mentions pre-existing water |
| **Purpose** | Creation exists to manifest divine attributes and allow humans to choose freely between faith and denial |

---

## 2. JINN

### 2.1 Nature and Ecology of Jinn [5/5 sources]

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Composition** | Created from *mārijin min nār* — "smokeless flame of fire" (Q 55:15) |
| **Created before humans** | Q 15:27 — God created jinn before humans |
| **Free will** | Unlike angels (who have no free will in Islamic theology), jinn choose belief or disbelief |
| **Societies** | Jinn have tribes, marriages, religions; some are Muslim, some not (Q 72:1-15, Surat al-Jinn) |
| **Habitat** | Deserts, ruins, marketplaces, bathhouses, crossroads (from hadith traditions) |
| **Lifespan** | Much longer than humans; some live for hundreds or thousands of years |
| **Visibility** | Normally invisible to humans; can appear in human or animal form |
| **Diet** | Bones and dung (from hadith) — leftover food becomes their sustenance |

### 2.2 Iblis — The Great Refuser [5/5 sources]

| Event | Quranic Account |
|-------|----------------|
| **God commands all to bow to Adam** | Q 2:34, 7:11-12, 15:28-35, 38:71-85 |
| **Iblis refuses** | "I am better than him; You created me from fire and him from clay" |
| **Iblis is NOT a fallen angel** | Q 18:50 explicitly states "he was of the jinn" — key Islamic theological distinction |
| **God grants Iblis respite** | Until the Day of Judgment; Iblis vows to mislead all of Adam's descendants |
| **Iblis becomes Shaytan** | From this point called "the Satan" — his role is to tempt, not to rule |
| **Not cosmic dualism** | Iblis is a creature, not a co-equal principle — radically different from Zoroastrian dualism (→ C19) |

### 2.3 Harut and Marut [3/5 sources]

- Q 2:102 mentions two angels, **Harut and Marut**, in Babylon who taught people magic
- Connection to **fallen angel** traditions (→ A04, Watchers in 1 Enoch)
- Possible etymological link to Zoroastrian **Haurvatat and Ameretat** (debated)
- Islamic scholars interpret variously — some as test, some as allegory
- Bridges between Jewish apocryphal Watcher tradition and Quranic theology

| Characteristic | Detail |
|----------------|--------|
| **Composition** | Created from light (*nūr*) — hadith, not Quran |
| **No free will** | Angels obey God's commands without exception (Q 66:6) |
| **No gender** | Despite sometimes being referred to with masculine grammar, angels are non-gendered |
| **Cannot disobey** | This is WHY Iblis CANNOT be an angel — he disobeyed |
| **Innumerable** | "None knows the armies of your Lord but He" (Q 74:31) |
| **Special abilities** | Can take human form; Gabriel appeared to Muhammad as a man; to Mary before Jesus's conception |

- Questioning by Munkar and Nakir occurs in this phase
- Parallels to Egyptian Duat, Greek Hades, and Christian purgatory concepts

## 6. COUNTER-ARGUMENTS AND SCHOLARLY DEBATE

| Claim | Supporting Evidence | Counter-Evidence | Assessment |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| Quranic cosmology draws on earlier Near Eastern traditions | Seven heavens parallel Mesopotamian/Jewish concepts; Isra/Mi'raj parallels Enoch; jinn have pre-Islamic Arabian roots | Muslims hold the Quran as divine revelation, not derivative; similarities may reflect common truth rather than borrowing | **Tier 1** — academic study of literary relationships is well-established; theological interpretation differs |
| Jinn are distinct from angels in Islamic ontology | Quran explicitly distinguishes them (Q 18:50); different substance (fire vs. light); jinn have free will | Pre-Islamic Arabian jinn traditions differ from Quranic presentation; some early Muslims conflated categories | **Tier 1** — clear Quranic distinction, though pre-Islamic Arabian concepts were more fluid |
| The Mi'raj describes an actual spiritual experience | Core Muslim belief; referenced in Quran (Q 17:1, 53:1-18); consistent across hadith collections | Could be visionary/dream experience; Aisha's hadith suggests spiritual rather than physical journey | **Within Islamic theology** — most Sunni scholars hold physical + spiritual; some allow purely spiritual |
| Islamic angelology was influenced by Zoroastrian-Jewish traditions | Chronological succession; structural parallels (Amesha Spentas → archangels) | Quranic angels function differently from both traditions; theological context is unique | **Tier 1-2** — influence is likely but Islamic angelology has its own distinctive features |
