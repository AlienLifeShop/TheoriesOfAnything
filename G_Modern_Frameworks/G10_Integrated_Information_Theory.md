# G10 — Integrated Information Theory (IIT)
## Consciousness as Intrinsic Causal Power

---

## Overview

**Integrated Information Theory (IIT)** proposes that consciousness IS integrated information — quantified as **Φ** (phi) — and that any system possessing non-zero Φ is, to some degree, conscious. Developed primarily by neuroscientist **Giulio Tononi** (University of Wisconsin-Madison) beginning in 2004, IIT has become the leading mathematical framework for consciousness, generating both fierce support and fierce opposition. Its implications — that consciousness is a fundamental property of matter rather than an emergent brain phenomenon — connect directly to panpsychist traditions found in Vedic, Hermetic, and animist worldviews tracked throughout this project.

## 2. The Theory: IIT 4.0 (Albantakis et al., 2023)

### 2.1 Five Axioms (Properties of Experience)

These are taken as self-evident properties of consciousness:

| # | Axiom | Description |
|---|-------|-------------|
| 1 | **Intrinsicality** | Consciousness exists for the system itself, not just for an external observer |
| 2 | **Composition** | Experience is structured — it has multiple distinguishable components |
| 3 | **Information** | Each experience is specific — it is THIS experience rather than any other possible one |
| 4 | **Integration** | Experience is unified — it cannot be decomposed into independent sub-experiences |
| 5 | **Exclusion** | Experience is definite — one and only one experience occurs at each moment, at one particular spatiotemporal grain |

### 2.2 Five Postulates (Physical Requirements)

Each axiom maps to a requirement for the physical substrate:

| # | Postulate | Physical Requirement |
|---|-----------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Intrinsicality** | The system must have cause-effect power upon itself (not merely observed correlation) |
| 2 | **Composition** | The system's elements must form mechanisms — subsets with causal roles |
| 3 | **Information** | Each mechanism must specify a particular cause-effect repertoire |
| 4 | **Integration** | The system's cause-effect structure must be unified — Φ > 0 means it cannot be partitioned without loss |
| 5 | **Exclusion** | The system exists at the spatiotemporal grain that maximizes Φ |

### 2.3 Phi (Φ) — Quantifying Consciousness

**Φ** measures the amount of integrated information a system generates above and beyond its parts.

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| **Φ = 0** | System is reducible to independent parts → no consciousness (e.g., photodiode array, feed-forward network) |
| **Φ > 0** | System generates information as a whole that cannot be generated by its parts separately → some degree of consciousness |
| **Maximum Φ** | The grain size and system boundary at which Φ is maximized defines the "complex" — the unit of consciousness |

**Critical limitation:** Computing Φ exactly is combinatorially explosive — even for ~100 neurons it exceeds current computational capacity. Practical applications (like PCI) use approximations.

## 3. Clinical Application: Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI)

**Reliability: TIER 1 — PEER-REVIEWED, CLINICALLY VALIDATED**

**Reference:** Casali et al. (2013), *Science Translational Medicine*

### 3.1 How PCI Works

1. Apply a TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) pulse to the cortex
2. Record the EEG response as it propagates
3. Measure the **complexity** of the response pattern using Lempel-Ziv compressibility
4. Low PCI = low consciousness (dreamless sleep, anesthesia, vegetative state)
5. High PCI = high consciousness (wakefulness, REM sleep, locked-in syndrome)

### 3.2 Clinical Results

| State | PCI Range | Implication |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Wakefulness** | 0.44–0.67 | Normal consciousness |
| **REM Sleep** | 0.41–0.52 | Dreaming = high integration |
| **NREM Sleep** | 0.18–0.28 | Deep sleep = low integration |
| **General Anesthesia** | 0.12–0.23 | Pharmacologically suppressed |
| **Vegetative State** | Typically < 0.31 | Some patients scored above threshold — suggesting hidden consciousness |
| **Locked-In Syndrome** | 0.51–0.62 | Fully conscious but unable to communicate — PCI correctly identifies this |

**Significance:** PCI is IIT's strongest empirical achievement — a theory-derived clinical tool that works. The detection of consciousness in apparently vegetative patients has direct ethical implications.

## 4. The Templeton Adversarial Collaboration

**Reliability: TIER 1 — PRE-REGISTERED, PEER-REVIEWED (Nature 2025)**

### 4.1 Design

The Templeton World Charity Foundation funded a ~$20M adversarial collaboration to pit IIT against GNWT (Stanislas Dehaene, Jean-Pierre Changeux, Bernard Baars). Both camps pre-registered specific predictions before experiments were run.

### 4.2 Results

| Theory | Predictions Confirmed | Details |
|--------|----------------------|---------|
| **IIT** | **2 of 3** | Posterior cortex signatures confirmed; temporal dynamics partially confirmed; exclusion postulate prediction inconclusive |
| **GNWT** | **0 of 3** | Predicted frontal "ignition" signatures not found; late P300 not uniquely tied to consciousness; broadcast mechanism unconfirmed |

### 4.3 Interpretation

- Neither theory was fully validated — consciousness science remains immature
- IIT outperformed GNWT in this specific test, but "winning" ≠ "proven"
- The **Nature Neuroscience** commentaries (March 2025) showed deep disagreement even among collaborators about what the results mean
- The 124-scholar letter's "pseudoscience" label sits uncomfortably next to IIT's 2/3 confirmed predictions from a $20M pre-registered study

## 5. Critiques and Controversies

### 5.1 The "Pseudoscience" Letter (September 2023)

124 scholars signed a PsyArXiv letter claiming IIT's panpsychism implications make it pseudoscientific. However:

| Finding | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Survey of signatories** | Only ~8% fully agreed with the "pseudoscience" label |
| **Many signatories** | Objected specifically to panpsychism, not to IIT's formalism |
| **Timing** | Published before Templeton results — would they have signed after IIT's 2/3 confirmation? |

### 5.2 Aaronson's Logic Gates Critique

**Scott Aaronson** (complexity theorist) demonstrated that under IIT's formalism, a grid of inactive logic gates could have higher Φ than the human brain — because IIT measures *potential* integration, not *actual* computational activity. This challenges the Exclusion postulate and suggests Φ may not track consciousness as intended.

### 5.3 Formal Critiques

| Critic | Year | Argument |
|--------|------|----------|
| **Doerig et al.** | 2019 | "Unfolding argument" — any IIT-conscious system can be replaced by a feed-forward (Φ=0) system with identical behavior → IIT predicts consciousness where behavior says there is none |
| **Tegmark** | 2016 | Computational complexity of Φ calculation makes the theory practically untestable for real brains |
| **Searle** | 2013 | IIT conflates information (observer-relative) with consciousness (intrinsic) — the theory is built on a category error |
| **Graziano** | 2019 | Attention Schema Theory offers a simpler, mechanistic explanation without any panpsychist commitments |
| **Merker** | 2021 | Subcortical consciousness in hydranencephalic children contradicts IIT's emphasis on cortical integration |

### 5.4 Supporters

| Proponent | Contribution |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Christof Koch** | IIT's primary experimental collaborator; led Templeton effort on IIT's behalf |
| **Anil Seth** | Uses IIT-adjacent frameworks; "controlled hallucination" model incorporates integrated information concepts |
| **David Chalmers** | Called IIT "the most promising" formal theory of consciousness (while noting unresolved problems) |

## 6. Ancient and Cross-Cultural Parallels

**Reliability: TIER 3 — INTERPRETIVE COMPARISON**

IIT's central claim — that consciousness is intrinsic to matter based on its informational structure — maps onto several ancient traditions:

| Tradition | Concept | IIT Parallel |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Vedic / Upanishadic** | *Brahman* as universal consciousness pervading all matter | Panpsychism — Φ > 0 in any integrated system |
| **Hermetic** (A08) | "The All is Mind" — *Kybalion* Principle of Mentalism | Consciousness as a fundamental property, not emergent |
| **Animism** (global) | All things — rocks, rivers, trees — possess spirit | IIT grants consciousness to any system with Φ > 0, regardless of biological substrate |
| **Buddhist** | *Vijñāna* — consciousness as one of the five aggregates, present in all sentient beings | Graded consciousness mapping to graded Φ |
| **Nag Hammadi / Gnostic** (A03) | The "divine spark" (*pneuma*) embedded in matter by a higher reality | IIT's intrinsicality axiom: consciousness is FOR the system itself, not imposed from outside |
| **Sumerian ME** (A06) | Divine programs (*me*) that imbue objects and offices with power | Information structures that grant functional "awareness" to systems |

**Note:** These parallels are structural, not evidential. IIT does not validate ancient claims about universal consciousness — but the convergence is notable given that IIT arrived at its framework through mathematics and neuroscience rather than mystical experience.

## 7. Integration with Project Themes

| Theme | IIT Connection |
|-------|---------------|
| **G01 — Quantum Mechanics** | IIT referenced in Planck Scale consciousness table; Orch-OR (Penrose-Hameroff) is a competitor framework that shares IIT's commitment to consciousness as fundamental |
| **G07 — Collective Consciousness** | IIT added to quantum consciousness comparison table; if Φ scales with integration, a network of minds could theoretically possess higher Φ than individual minds |
| **G09 — Pineal Gland** | DMT and altered states may change Φ by altering cortical integration patterns — PCI during psychedelic states shows increased complexity |
| **G02 — Simulation Theory** | If consciousness = Φ, then a simulation would need to generate real Φ to contain conscious beings — this either means consciousness is substrate-independent (simulations contain real consciousness) or simulation is impossible |
| **D10 — Sacred Geometry** | Φ (the consciousness measure) is coincidentally the same symbol as the Golden Ratio φ — a connection IIT does not claim but that resonates with sacred geometry's emphasis on mathematical structures underlying reality |
| **H01 — Suppression** | The "pseudoscience" letter demonstrates how institutional resistance operates within academia itself — an IIT-specific example of knowledge suppression dynamics |
