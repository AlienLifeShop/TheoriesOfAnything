## QUICK SUMMARY

**Morphic resonance** is a hypothesis proposed by biologist **Rupert Sheldrake** (b. 1942, Cambridge-trained plant physiologist) that proposes **nature operates by habits, not fixed laws**, and that organisms and systems are influenced by a **cumulative memory of their species** transmitted through **morphic fields** — non-physical fields that carry information about form and behavior across space and time. In Sheldrake's model, when a new crystal form is synthesized for the first time, it is hard to crystallize; subsequent crystallizations worldwide become progressively easier — not because of seed crystal contamination, but because the **morphic field** has "learned" the pattern. Similarly, when rats learn a new maze, subsequent rats everywhere learn it faster through **morphic resonance** rather than genetic transmission. The hypothesis was introduced in *A New Science of Life* (1981) and was immediately controversial — *Nature* editor John Maddox called it "the best candidate for burning there has been for many years." Sheldrake's work occupies a unique position: he is a genuine PhD scientist working at the boundary between biology and metaphysics, proposing a hypothesis that is **theoretically coherent** but has **limited reproducible empirical support**. The hypothesis intersects with Jung's collective unconscious, Waddington's chreodes, and Laszlo's Akashic field, and raises fundamental questions about the nature of natural laws.

## 1. THE HYPOTHESIS

### 1.1 Core Propositions [5/5 sources]

| Proposition | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **Morphic fields** | Self-organizing fields that govern the form and behavior of systems at all levels — atoms, molecules, cells, organisms, societies |
| **Morphic resonance** | The process by which a morphic field is influenced by previous similar systems — cumulative memory across time and space |
| **Habits, not laws** | "Laws of nature" are better understood as evolving habits — regularities that have become entrenched through repetition |
| **No energy transfer** | Morphic resonance operates through similarity, not energetic causation — no known physical mechanism |
| **Cumulative** | The more times a pattern occurs, the stronger the morphic field becomes, making future occurrences more likely |
| **Non-local** | Effects are not attenuated by distance or time — similar forms anywhere resonate with all previous similar forms |

### 1.2 Sheldrake's Background [4/5 sources]

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| **Education** | Cambridge University (Natural Sciences); Clare College; PhD in biochemistry; Frank Knox Fellow at Harvard |
| **Early career** | Worked at Royal Society's plant hormone lab; published conventional plant physiology papers; research fellow at Cambridge |
| **Turning point** | Went to work at ICRISAT in Hyderabad, India (crop physiology); studied Indian philosophy; formulated hypothesis |
| **Publication** | *A New Science of Life* (1981); *The Presence of the Past* (1988); *Science Set Free* (2012) |
| **Controversy** | TED talk removed (2013); debate with Richard Dawkins; John Maddox Nature editorial (1981) |

## 2. EVIDENCE CLAIMED

### 2.1 Sheldrake's Key Evidence Claims [4/5 sources]

| Claim | Alleged Evidence | Status |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| **New crystal forms** | New compounds are initially hard to crystallize; it becomes easier over time worldwide | **Anecdotal** — chemists report this informally; no controlled study; seed crystal transfer is the conventional explanation |
| **Rat learning transfer** | William McDougall's 1920s-40s Harvard experiments: successive generations of rats learned faster | **Mixed** — McDougall's data exists but methodology was criticized; Crew's Edinburgh replication was ambiguous |
| **IQ test score inflation** | Cultural IQ test scores rise over time (Flynn Effect); Sheldrake suggests morphic resonance contributes | **Tier 3** — Flynn Effect is real but has many conventional explanations (nutrition, education, test familiarity) |
| **Chick behavior** | Chicks from naive mothers showed fear responses to hawk silhouettes without learning | **Partial** — established ethology explains this via biological preparedness/instinct; morphic resonance is unnecessary |
| **Human learning** | New skills (like learning to ride a bicycle) should become easier over time for the whole species | **Untestable** as stated — confounded by improved teaching methods, nutrition, technology |
| **Cross-word puzzles** | After a crossword puzzle is published and solved by millions, it should become easier for later solvers via morphic resonance | **One study** (Sheldrake, 1983 with BBC) showed a small effect; not independently replicated |

### 2.2 The Crystallization Argument [3/5 sources]

Sheldrake's strongest intuitive argument:
- Organic chemists frequently report that **newly synthesized compounds are hard to crystallize** initially
- Over time (months, years), the same compound becomes **much easier to crystallize** worldwide
- **Conventional explanation:** Microscopic seed crystals from the first laboratory spread through air, on scientists' beards, in conference venues
- **Sheldrake's explanation:** Morphic resonance — the morphic field "learns" the crystal form
- **Assessment:** The seed crystal explanation is parsimonious and has experimental support; morphic resonance adds an unneeded explanatory layer

## 3. SCIENTIFIC RECEPTION AND CRITIQUE

### 3.1 The Nature Controversy [5/5 sources]

| Event | Date | Detail |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Publication of *A New Science of Life*** | June 1981 | Published by Blond & Briggs (London) |
| **Nature editorial by John Maddox** | Sept 24, 1981 | "A Book for Burning?" — called it "the best candidate for burning there has been for many years"; compared to Lysenko |
| **Sheldrake's response** | 1981-83 | Accused scientific establishment of censorship and closed-mindedness |
| **BBC experiment** | 1983 | Sheldrake designed a morphic resonance test with BBC — results inconclusive |
| **TED talk removal** | 2013 | TEDx talk "The Science Delusion" removed from main TED site — TED said it "crossed the line into pseudoscience" |
| **Debate with Dawkins** | 2007 | Sheldrake accused Dawkins of not reading his work before dismissing it; encounter was contentious |

### 3.2 Mainstream Scientific Criticism [5/5 sources]

| Criticism | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **No mechanism** | Morphic fields have no proposed physical mechanism; no particles, no forces, no energy transfer |
| **Unfalsifiable** | Critics argue the hypothesis can accommodate any result — if effects aren't found, the morphic field is "too weak" |
| **Parsimony** | Conventional biology (genetics, epigenetics → R04, learning, instinct) explains the phenomena cited without new fields |
| **Reproducibility** | Key claimed experiments have not been independently reproduced |
| **Incompatibility** | Violates conservation of information; incompatible with established physics (no known non-local information transfer without entanglement) |
| **Cherry-picking** | Critics argue Sheldrake selects anomalies and ignores the vast majority of biology that works fine without morphic resonance |

### 3.3 Sheldrake's Defense [4/5 sources]

| Defense | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Science as dogma** | In *Science Set Free* (2012), Sheldrake argues 10 core assumptions of mainstream science are themselves unproven dogmas |
| **Historical precedent** | Gravitational fields, electromagnetic fields, and quantum fields were all "mysterious" when proposed |
| **Explanatory gap** | Mainstream biology cannot fully explain morphogenesis, habit formation, or memory in non-neural organisms (e.g., slime molds) |
| **Suppression claim** | Sheldrake argues his work is suppressed not because it's wrong, but because it threatens materialist paradigm |

## 4. CONNECTIONS TO OTHER FIELDS

### 4.1 Related Concepts [4/5 sources]

| Concept | Proponent | Relationship to Morphic Resonance |
|---------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| **Collective unconscious** | Carl Jung | Universal psychological patterns (archetypes) shared across humanity; partially overlaps with morphic resonance of behavior |
| **Chreodes** | C.H. Waddington | Developmental "canalized pathways" that guide embryonic development; Sheldrake cites as partial precursor |
| **Akashic field** | Ervin Laszlo | "Cosmic memory field" storing all information; more speculative than Sheldrake; New Age framing |
| **Biofield hypothesis** | Beverly Rubik | Electromagnetic/bioenergetic fields around organisms; some overlap but different mechanism |
| **Hundredth monkey** | Lyall Watson | Claimed (falsely) that after 100 monkeys learned to wash potatoes, all monkeys suddenly knew — actually not documented; Sheldrake distances himself from this |
| **Epigenetics** | Various (→ R04) | Heritable non-genetic changes; Sheldrake argues morphic resonance extends beyond individual epigenetic inheritance |

## 5. COUNTER-ARGUMENTS AND ASSESSMENT

| Claim | Supporting Evidence | Counter-Evidence | Assessment |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| Morphic resonance explains why new compounds become easier to crystallize | Anecdotal reports from chemists; pattern matches prediction | Seed crystal contamination is well-documented and sufficient; no controlled study isolating morphic resonance | **Tier 3** — interesting observation but conventional explanation is adequate |
| Rat learning can transfer non-genetically to future generations | McDougall's 1920s-40s experiments showed improvement across generations | Methodology criticized; Crew's replication ambiguous; genetic selection/maternal effects not controlled | **Tier 3** — experiments are suggestive but inconclusive |
| "Laws of nature" are better understood as habits | Philosophical coherence; Charles Peirce proposed similar idea 1890s; cosmological constants might drift | Physical constants are measured as constant to extraordinary precision (e.g., fine-structure constant measured to 12 decimal places) | **Tier 3** — philosophically interesting but no evidence of constants changing |
| Sheldrake is unfairly suppressed | TED talk removal; Nature editorial; difficulty publishing in mainstream journals | Sheldrake has published books, given talks, appeared on major media; his ideas are well-known | **Tier 2-3** — he faces skepticism, not suppression; he has a large public platform |
| Morphic resonance is pseudoscience | No mechanism; no reproducible evidence; unfalsifiable as commonly stated | Sheldrake has a PhD, published in peer-reviewed journals, proposes testable (if difficult to test) predictions | **Tier 2-3** — more accurately "protoscience" — a hypothesis at the boundary that needs better evidence |
