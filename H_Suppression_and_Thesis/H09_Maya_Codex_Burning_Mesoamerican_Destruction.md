## QUICK SUMMARY

The systematic destruction of Maya manuscripts represents one of history's most devastating losses of accumulated knowledge. Bishop Diego de Landa's 1562 auto-da-fé at Maní destroyed thousands of Maya texts, leaving only four surviving codices from an entire civilization's literary output. This event was part of a broader pattern of Mesoamerican knowledge destruction that included Aztec emperor Itzcoatl's deliberate burning of historical records in 1428 CE and the subsequent Spanish colonial campaigns against indigenous intellectual traditions. The paradox that Landa himself authored the most important surviving account of Maya culture underscores the complexity of colonial knowledge politics. The loss extends beyond literature to astronomical tables, medical knowledge, genealogical records, and cultural memory spanning millennia.

## 1. VERIFIED CLAIMS (Tier 1 — Peer-Reviewed / Archaeological Record)

### 1.1 Diego de Landa's Auto-da-Fé at Maní (July 12, 1562)
- Franciscan friar Diego de Landa conducted an inquisitorial action (*auto-da-fé*) at the town of Maní in the Yucatán Peninsula
- His own account records the destruction of approximately 27 rolls of hieroglyphic manuscripts ("books"), 5,000+ cult images, 197 ceremonial vessels, and 13 large stones used as altars
- Landa justified the destruction: *"We found a large number of books... and as they contained nothing in which were not to be seen superstition and lies of the devil, we burned them all"*
- The action was part of a broader inquisition investigating continued indigenous religious practices among baptized Maya
- Landa was subsequently recalled to Spain and investigated for exceeding his authority — the secular colonial authorities objected to his methods

### 1.2 The Four Surviving Maya Codices
- **Dresden Codex** (Sächsische Landesbibliothek, Dresden): 78 pages, primarily astronomical/mathematical tables including remarkably accurate Venus cycle calculations, eclipse prediction tables, and flood imagery; likely created 11th-12th century CE; damaged in WWII bombing of Dresden (1945)
- **Madrid Codex** (Museo de América, Madrid): 112 pages (longest surviving), primarily ritual almanacs and divination tables; likely 15th century; discovered in two parts in the 1860s
- **Paris Codex** (Bibliothèque nationale de France): 22 pages, prophecy cycles, katun wheels, and a Maya zodiac; rediscovered in a basket at the library in 1859, edges severely deteriorated
- **Grolier Codex** (Museo Nacional de Antropología, Mexico City): 10 fragmentary pages, Venus tables; authenticity debated for decades, confirmed as genuine in 2016 by Brown University study (radiocarbon dating to 13th century)

### 1.3 Itzcoatl's Aztec Book Burning (c. 1428 CE)
- Aztec ruler Itzcoatl (r. 1427-1440) ordered the destruction of historical records following the defeat of the Tepanec Empire
- Recorded in the *Codex Matritense*: he commanded that pictorial histories be burned to rewrite the official narrative of Aztec origins
- This was political self-censorship — rewriting history to elevate the Mexica from tributary status to divinely ordained rulers
- Represents a pre-colonial example of deliberate knowledge destruction

### 1.4 Scale of Spanish Colonial Destruction
- Multiple burning events occurred across Mesoamerica, not just Landa's action
- Juan de Zumárraga, first Bishop of Mexico (appointed 1528), oversaw destruction of Aztec/Nahua manuscripts in central Mexico — though the exact scale attributed to him is debated
- Systematic destruction of temple libraries during and after the conquest of Tenochtitlan (1521)
- Destruction continued throughout the 16th and 17th centuries as part of *extirpación de idolatrías* campaigns

## 2. CREDIBLE CLAIMS (Tier 2 — Academic / Debated but Supported)

### 2.1 The Landa Paradox
- The same Diego de Landa who burned Maya codices authored *Relación de las cosas de Yucatán* (c. 1566), written during his defense in Spain
- This text remains the single most important colonial-era source on Maya culture, religion, calendar systems, and daily life
- Landa's "alphabet" — his attempt to record Maya hieroglyphics as an alphabet — was crucial to the eventual decipherment of Maya script (Knorozov, 1952; later Schele, Stuart, and Houston)
- Scholarly debate: Did Landa genuinely regret the scale of destruction, or was the *Relación* purely a political document for his defense?
- Matthew Restall and others argue the paradox reflects the contradictions inherent in colonial epistemology — the simultaneous desire to know and to destroy

### 2.2 Scope of Lost Knowledge
- Maya scribal tradition was extensive: elite scribes (*aj tz'ib*) produced texts on bark paper (*huun*), deerskin, and stucco-coated surfaces
- Archaeological evidence from painted pottery, murals (Bonampak, San Bartolo), and carved monuments confirms sophisticated literary and artistic traditions
- Lost content likely included: extended astronomical tables, detailed historical chronicles, genealogical records, medical/pharmacological knowledge, agricultural calendars, diplomatic correspondence, and mythological narratives
- Michael Coe estimated that surviving Maya texts represent less than one-thousandth of one percent of what once existed

### 2.3 Mixtec and Zapotec Codex Destruction
- Pre-Columbian Mixtec codices survive in greater numbers than Maya ones (e.g., Codex Nuttall, Codex Vindobonensis, Codex Bodley), suggesting the Mixtec tradition was also extensive
- Zapotec manuscript tradition is almost entirely lost — no pre-Columbian Zapotec codices survive
- The comparative survival of some Mixtec codices (perhaps due to earlier Spanish acquisition as curiosities) highlights the arbitrariness of what was preserved vs. destroyed

### 2.4 Impact on Calendar and Astronomical Knowledge
- The Dresden Codex demonstrates Maya astronomers calculated the Venus synodic period as 583.92 days (modern value: 583.92 days) — effectively perfect
- Eclipse prediction tables in the Dresden Codex show cycles identified over centuries of observation
- The destroyed codices likely contained even more extensive astronomical records — the surviving texts may represent only introductory summaries of a much larger body of work
- Loss of long-count calendar correlation data complicates modern attempts to synchronize Maya and Western chronologies (the GMT correlation remains debated)

## 3. SPECULATIVE CLAIMS (Tier 3 — Possible but Unverified)

### 3.1 Undiscovered Surviving Codices
- Persistent speculation that additional Maya codices may survive in private collections, Vatican archives, or undiscovered archaeological contexts
- The Grolier Codex's provenance (allegedly found in a cave in Chiapas in the 1960s) suggests cave caches may preserve additional manuscripts
- The dry caves of the Yucatán highlands and Chiapas remain incompletely surveyed
- Some researchers speculate that codices may have been hidden by Maya priests who anticipated destruction

### 3.2 Depth of Mathematical and Scientific Knowledge
- The Dresden Codex's accuracy suggests a tradition of mathematical astronomy far more sophisticated than what four codices can reveal
- Possible that destroyed codices contained knowledge of planetary periods beyond Venus and Mars, stellar proper motion observations, or mathematical concepts not yet attributed to the Maya
- Some researchers argue Maya medical knowledge (herbal pharmacology, surgical techniques) was systematically recorded and lost

### 3.3 Oral Tradition as Partial Preservation
- Maya communities maintained oral traditions that preserved some knowledge from destroyed texts
- The *Popol Vuh* (→ A13), recorded in alphabetic K'iche' Maya c. 1554-1558, may reflect content from destroyed pictorial manuscripts
- The *Books of Chilam Balam* (colonial-era Yucatec Maya texts) similarly may preserve pre-conquest knowledge in altered form
- Degree to which oral tradition accurately preserved pre-conquest knowledge is debated

## 4. DUBIOUS CLAIMS (Tier 4 — No Credible Source)

### 4.1 Claims of Vast Hidden Maya Libraries
- Stories of large hidden caches of Maya manuscripts deliberately concealed from the Spanish — no archaeological evidence supports large-scale organized concealment
- Claims that the Vatican secretly holds dozens of Maya codices — no credible evidence despite Vatican library access by researchers

### 4.2 Maya Codices Containing Advanced Technology
- Fringe claims that destroyed codices contained descriptions of advanced technology (aircraft, electricity, nuclear weapons) — entirely speculative and unsupported
- Projecting modern technology onto pre-Columbian cultures without evidence

### 4.3 Exaggerated Destruction Numbers
- Some popular accounts inflate the number of manuscripts destroyed at Maní to "millions" — Landa's own account gives specific (and already devastating) numbers
- Claims that Zumárraga personally destroyed "all" Aztec literature are oversimplified — destruction was carried out by multiple agents over decades
