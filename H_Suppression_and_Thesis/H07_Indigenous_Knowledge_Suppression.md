## QUICK SUMMARY

**Epistemicide** — the systematic destruction of rival knowledge systems — is arguably the most devastating and least acknowledged consequence of global colonialism. Between 1492 and 1950, European colonial powers destroyed, suppressed, or marginalized knowledge traditions across every inhabited continent. The destruction was not incidental but ideological: indigenous knowledge was classified as "superstition" or "savagery" within Enlightenment racial hierarchies, justifying its replacement with "civilization." The scale of loss is staggering: of ~7,000 languages existing in 1500 CE, linguists project 50–90% will be extinct by 2100; each language carries unique ecological, medicinal, astronomical, and philosophical knowledge (→ P16). This document catalogs both the mechanisms of suppression and the documented value of knowledge systems that were targeted, distinguishing between well-documented historical destruction (Tier 1) and broader theoretical frameworks (Tier 2).

## 1. DEFINING EPISTEMICIDE

### 1.1 Boaventura de Sousa Santos and Abyssal Thinking [4/5 sources]

Portuguese sociologist **Boaventura de Sousa Santos** coined the term **"epistemicide"** to describe the destruction of knowledge as a dimension of colonialism equal to genocide and cultural destruction:

- **"Abyssal thinking"**: A cognitive framework that draws a "radical line" dividing human thought into two sides — knowledge that "counts" (modern Western science, philosophy, law) and knowledge that is invisible (indigenous, folk, traditional)
- Knowledge on the "other side of the line" is not merely wrong — it is **unintelligible**, not recognized as knowledge at all
- The colonial project required not only political and economic domination but the **delegitimation of indigenous ways of knowing** — without this, colonial rule lacked justification

### 1.2 Linda Tuhiwai Smith — Decolonizing Methodologies [4/5 sources]

Māori scholar **Linda Tuhiwai Smith** (*Decolonizing Methodologies*, 1999) analyzed how Western research itself became a tool of colonialism:
- The word "research" is "one of the dirtiest words in the indigenous world's vocabulary" — associated with extraction, exploitation, and misrepresentation
- Western **classificatory systems** (Linnaean taxonomy, racial hierarchies, evolutionary stages) organized indigenous peoples as objects of study rather than subjects of their own knowledge
- Research standards that privilege written documentation over oral tradition automatically marginalize societies with oral knowledge systems
- **Recovery:** Indigenous communities are now developing their own research methodologies that center indigenous epistemologies, ethics, and community benefit

### 1.3 Taxonomy of Knowledge Suppression

| Type | Mechanism | Examples |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Direct destruction** | Burning, confiscation, killing knowledge-holders | Spanish codex burnings; massacre of Aztec priests |
| **Linguistic suppression** | Banning native languages; forced adoption of colonial language | Residential schools; punishing children for speaking native languages |
| **Religious conversion** | Replacing indigenous cosmology with Christian/Islamic frameworks | Mission systems worldwide |
| **Legal prohibition** | Outlawing indigenous practices | Sun Dance ban (U.S. 1883–1934); Australian Aboriginal ceremony restrictions |
| **Institutional exclusion** | Defining "knowledge" to exclude indigenous systems | Academic standards requiring written sources; peer review gatekeeping |
| **Extraction without attribution** | Taking indigenous knowledge without credit | Ethnobotanical bioprospecting; pharmaceutical development from traditional medicines |

## 2. MECHANISMS OF KNOWLEDGE SUPPRESSION

### 2.1 Residential/Boarding School Systems [5/5 sources]

The most systematic mechanism of knowledge suppression was the **forced education** of indigenous children:

**United States — Indian Boarding Schools:**
- Founded by Captain Richard Henry Pratt (1879): motto "Kill the Indian, save the man"
- ~100,000 children removed from families (1870s–1960s)
- Children punished (physically) for speaking native languages, practicing ceremonies, or wearing traditional clothing
- **Bryan Newland Report (2022):** Interior Department investigation documented 408+ schools, 53+ burial sites, ~500+ child deaths (likely far more)
- Result: Multiple languages lost when the last fluent elders (who survived these schools) died without transmitting knowledge

**Canada — Residential Schools:**
- ~150,000 indigenous children (1883–1996; last school closed 1996)
- **Truth and Reconciliation Commission (2015):** Documented 3,200+ child deaths; classified system as **cultural genocide**
- Children forbidden from speaking Cree, Ojibwe, Inuktitut, and other languages — many lost connection to traditional knowledge permanently

**Australia — Stolen Generations:**
- 1910–1970: ~100,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children forcibly removed from families
- Children placed in white institutions or families; cut off from Dreaming knowledge, language, and country (→ C30)
- **Bringing Them Home Report (1997):** Classified as systematic attempt to "breed out" Aboriginal identity

### 2.2 Missionary Knowledge Replacement [4/5 sources]

Global missionary campaigns systematically replaced indigenous knowledge systems:
- **Mesoamerica:** Franciscan and Dominican friars destroyed Maya codices, Aztec amoxtli (painted books), religious sculptures, and ceremonial objects — Diego de Landa burned an estimated 27+ Maya codices at Maní in 1562 (→ M07, C37)
- **West Africa:** Missionaries destroyed Igbo, Yoruba, and Akan spiritual artifacts and disrupted initiatory knowledge transmission systems
- **Pacific Islands:** Christian missions in Hawaii, Polynesia, and Melanesia suppressed hula (banned 1830s–1880s), navigation knowledge, and cosmological chanting traditions
- **India:** British colonial education (Macaulay's Minute, 1835) systematically devalued Sanskrit, Persian, and Arabic learning in favor of English

### 2.3 Legal and Institutional Suppression [4/5 sources]

Colonial and post-colonial states used **legal prohibition** to suppress knowledge practices:
- **U.S. Code of Indian Offenses (1883):** Banned Sun Dance, potlatch, and traditional healing practices; penalties included imprisonment and withholding rations
- **Australian state laws:** Prohibited Aboriginal ceremonies in certain areas; controlled movement prevented access to sacred sites (→ D13)
- **South Africa:** Apartheid-era Bantu Education Act (1953) deliberately provided inferior education to Black South Africans — designed to prevent intellectual development outside labor skills
- **Peru:** Traditional coca-leaf use (with millennia of indigenous cultural significance) criminalized under international drug conventions based on Western pharmaceutical classification

## 3. CASE STUDIES OF CULTURAL KNOWLEDGE DESTRUCTION

### 3.1 Mesoamerican Knowledge Systems [5/5 sources]

The Spanish destruction of Mesoamerican written knowledge is the most thoroughly documented epistemicide:

**What was destroyed:**
- Maya: Tens of thousands of inscribed monuments were intact in 1500; ~20 major cities had extensive hieroglyphic texts; only **4 codices** survive (Dresden, Madrid, Paris, Grolier/Maya)
- Aztec: Extensive *amoxtli* (screenfold books) on history, astronomy, tribute, ritual — virtually all destroyed; survivors include Codex Borbonicus, Codex Mendoza (colonial-era copies)
- Knowledge of Maya writing was **completely lost** — not deciphered until Knorosov (1952) and subsequent work (→ C37)

**What survived (fragmentary):**
- Colonial-era transcriptions by sympathetic friars — notably **Bernardino de Sahagún's** *Florentine Codex* (1576), which recorded Nahua knowledge in Nahuatl, and the *Popol Vuh* transcription in K'iche' Maya (→ A13)
- These are invaluable but represent a fraction of what existed and filtered through the compiler's Christian worldview

### 3.2 Australian Aboriginal Knowledge [4/5 sources]

Aboriginal Australians maintained the world's **oldest continuous knowledge system** (~65,000+ years) — largely orally transmitted through song, story, ceremony, and landscape:
- **Songlines/Dreaming tracks:** Vast networks of oral knowledge encoding geography, ecology, law, history, and cosmology across thousands of kilometers (→ C30)
- **Ecological knowledge:** Fire-management techniques ("firestick farming") now recognized as superior to European-Australian land management — leading to "cultural burns" programs after catastrophic 2019–2020 fires
- **Astronomical knowledge:** Aboriginal groups independently identified stellar phenomena — Duane Hamacher documented Aboriginal observations of variable stars, solar eclipses, and meteor impacts preserved in oral tradition
- **Loss:** Of ~250 Aboriginal languages spoken at European contact (1788), ~130 are critically endangered or extinct; each carried unique ecological and ceremonial knowledge

### 3.3 African Knowledge Systems [4/5 sources]

Colonial destruction of African knowledge is less documented precisely because colonial historiography denied Africa had "knowledge systems":
- **Timbuktu manuscripts:** Hundreds of thousands of manuscripts in Arabic, Ajami, and local languages on astronomy, mathematics, medicine, law, and theology — many hidden by families during colonial period and now being digitized (→ F07)
- **Ironworking traditions:** African iron smelting (from ~1000 BCE in Great Lakes region) involved specialized knowledge transmitted through apprenticeship — colonial industrialization disrupted these chains (→ C40)
- **Oral historiography:** Historians like **D.T. Niane** documented Malian *griots* preserving the *Sundiata* epic — a sophisticated historiographical tradition dismissed as "myth" by colonial historians but now recognized as containing verified historical information

## 4. WHAT WAS LOST — SCALE OF DESTRUCTION

### 4.1 Linguistic Extinction [5/5 sources]

Language death is the most measurable indicator of knowledge loss:
- **Pre-colonial:** ~7,000+ languages spoken worldwide
- **Current:** ~7,000 languages surviving (due to new language creation) — but distribution radically altered
- **Endangered:** UNESCO classifies ~2,500 languages as endangered; **one language dies every ~2 weeks**
- **Projections:** 50–90% of current languages may be extinct by 2100 (Krauss 1992, updated estimates)
- **Knowledge loss per language:** Each language encodes unique:
  - **Ecological knowledge:** Names for species, ecological relationships, seasonal patterns
  - **Medicinal knowledge:** ~80% of global population uses traditional medicine (WHO estimate); many remedies are language-specific
  - **Cognitive frameworks:** Unique ways of categorizing reality — some languages lack number words, some have obligatory evidentiality markers, some use absolute rather than relative spatial reference
  - **Historical memory:** Oral traditions encoding migrations, climate events, astronomical observations (→ D19)

### 4.2 Ethnobotanical Knowledge Loss [4/5 sources]

**Scale of traditional medicinal knowledge:**
- ~50,000–80,000 plant species used medicinally worldwide (Schippmann et al. 2002)
- ~25% of modern pharmaceuticals derive from traditional plant use (aspirin from willow bark, quinine from cinchona, morphine from opium poppy)
- **Biopiracy:** Pharmaceutical companies patent traditional knowledge without benefit-sharing — the neem tree case (India), the ayahuasca patent attempt (Amazon), the hoodia case (San people)
- **Rate of loss:** As elders die without successors, millennia of empirical medicinal knowledge disappear; ethnobotanist **Paul Cox** estimates we are losing traditional medicinal knowledge faster than we are losing biodiversity itself

### 4.3 What Survived — Resilience and Resistance [4/5 sources]

Despite systematic suppression, indigenous knowledge showed remarkable resilience:
- **Syncretism:** Many communities preserved knowledge by encoding it within Christian/Islamic frameworks — Andean Catholicism preserving Pachamama worship; Vodou preserving Yoruba/Fon theology
- **Hidden transmission:** Knowledge went underground — Aboriginal ceremonies continued in remote areas; Maya daykeepers maintained the 260-day calendar continuously
- **Oral tradition durability:** Aboriginal Australian oral traditions have been confirmed to encode events from the last Ice Age (~10,000+ years) — sea level rise, volcanic eruptions, megafaunal extinctions (→ C30)
- **Revival movements:** Hawaiian language revitalization (from ~1,000 speakers in 1980s to ~24,000 today); Māori language in education (kōhanga reo/language nests)

## 5. RECOVERY, DECOLONIZATION, AND REPATRIATION

### 5.1 Knowledge Repatriation Movements [4/5 sources]

**Physical repatriation:**
- **NAGPRA** (Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, 1990): Requires U.S. museums to return human remains and sacred objects — ~200,000 remains repatriated to date
- **Benin Bronzes:** 2021–2023 returns from Germany, UK, and other European museums to Nigeria
- **Parthenon marbles debate:** Greece's ongoing claim for return of marbles removed by Lord Elgin (1801–1812)

**Intellectual repatriation:**
- Indigenous communities gaining control over research conducted on/about them
- **CARE Principles** (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics) for indigenous data governance
- Digital repatriation: Digitizing and returning copies of colonial-era recordings, photographs, and manuscripts to source communities

### 5.2 Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) Recognition [4/5 sources]

Indigenous knowledge is increasingly recognized as complementary to scientific knowledge:
- **IPCC and IPBES:** Intergovernmental science bodies now formally incorporate indigenous and local knowledge
- **Fire management:** Aboriginal burning practices adopted in Australia, California, and elsewhere after mega-fire disasters
- **Marine management:** Pacific Islander traditional fishing practices inform modern marine protected area design
- **Climate observation:** Arctic indigenous peoples' observations of ice, weather, and animal behavior provide data unavailable from instruments
- **Two-Eyed Seeing (Etuaptmumk):** Framework developed by Mi'kmaw Elder Albert Marshall — integrating the strengths of indigenous and Western knowledge systems without reducing either

## 6. COUNTER-ARGUMENTS AND SCHOLARLY DEBATE

### 6.1 Critiques of the Epistemicide Framework

**Arguments against overly broad epistemicide claims:**
- Not all knowledge loss was intentional — some traditional practices declined due to modernization choices by indigenous peoples themselves
- Romanticizing all pre-colonial knowledge risks ignoring harmful practices within traditional systems (e.g., certain forms of traditional justice)
- Indigenous knowledge is not monolithic — communities had their own internal knowledge hierarchies and suppressions
- The framework can overstate Western science as purely colonial while ignoring contributions by non-Western scientists within the scientific tradition

**Responses:**
- These critiques are largely valid at the individual level but do not diminish the **systemic** and **state-directed** nature of knowledge destruction
- Acknowledging indigenous agency does not require ignoring the power imbalance: when governments ban languages at gunpoint, "choice" is not the operative concept
- The goal of decolonial epistemology is not to reject Western science but to recognize that **multiple valid knowledge systems** exist and that the exclusion of non-Western systems impoverishes human understanding
