## QUICK SUMMARY

The Knights Templar (Order of the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon) were a medieval Catholic military order founded ~1119 CE, active for nearly 200 years until their dramatic suppression in 1307–1312. Beginning as nine knights protecting pilgrims to the Holy Land, they grew into one of the most powerful and wealthy organizations in Christendom — pioneering international banking, building a network of thousands of commanderies, and fielding elite military forces across the Crusades. Their sudden arrest by Philip IV of France (Friday, October 13, 1307), trials for heresy, and dissolution by Pope Clement V generated centuries of legend about hidden treasure, secret knowledge, and esoteric connections. The 2007 publication of the Chinon Parchment confirmed the Pope had privately absolved the Templar leadership of heresy — suggesting political, not religious, motives drove their destruction. Separating documented history (Tier 1) from legend (Tier 3–4) is central to this analysis.

## 1. VERIFIED CLAIMS (Tier 1 — Peer-Reviewed / Archaeological Record)

### 1.1 Foundation and Rise (1119–1187) [1/5 sources]

- **Source:** Barber, Malcolm. *The New Knighthood: A History of the Order of the Temple*. Cambridge University Press, 1994; Riley-Smith, Jonathan. *The Knights Hospitaller in the Levant, c.1070–1309*. Palgrave Macmillan, 2012.
- **Founding:** ~1119 CE (traditional date; some sources say 1118 or 1120)
- **Founders:** Hugues de Payens (first Grand Master) and eight other French knights
- **Original mission:** Protect Christian pilgrims traveling to Jerusalem after the First Crusade (1099)
- **Headquarters:** Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount, Jerusalem — believed by Crusaders to be the site of Solomon's Temple (hence "Templars")
- **Council of Troyes (1129):** Officially endorsed by the Catholic Church; received formal Rule (monastic regulations) likely authored/influenced by Bernard of Clairvaux
- **Bernard of Clairvaux:** Wrote *In Praise of the New Knighthood* (*Liber ad milites Templi: De laude novae militiae*, ~1129) — powerful theological endorsement combining monastic discipline with military service
- **Papal Bull *Omne Datum Optimum* (1139):** Pope Innocent II granted Templars extraordinary privileges:
  - Exempt from local taxes
  - Answerable ONLY to the Pope (not to kings or bishops)
  - Could build their own oratories
  - Could keep all spoils of war
  - These privileges fueled both power and resentment

### 1.2 The Templar Banking System [1/5 sources]

- **Source:** Nicholson, Helen. *The Knights Templar: A New History*. Sutton, 2001; Barber (1994).
- The Templars developed what historians consider Europe's first international banking system:
  - **Letters of credit:** Pilgrims could deposit money at a Templar commandery in Europe, receive a coded letter, and withdraw equivalent funds in the Holy Land — eliminating the need to carry gold on dangerous roads
  - **Lending to kings:** Templars financed Crusades, lent to monarchs (including Philip IV of France — who later destroyed them partly to avoid repaying debts)
  - **Property management:** Vast agricultural estates across Europe (~9,000 commanderies at peak)
  - **Financial innovation:** Developed early forms of checks, trust management, and international fund transfer
- **Wealth:** At peak (mid-13th century), the Templar order was wealthier than most European kingdoms
- **Historical significance:** The Templar model influenced later banking houses (Lombard banks, Medici) and monetary instruments

### 1.3 Military Role [1/5 sources]

| Battle/Event | Date | Significance |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| Battle of Montgisard | 1177 | 500 Templars + small force defeated Saladin's 26,000-strong army |
| Fall of Jerusalem | 1187 | Saladin captured Jerusalem; Templars lost their headquarters |
| Battle of Hattin | 1187 | Devastating Crusader defeat; 230 captured Templars executed en masse by Saladin's order |
| Siege of Acre | 1191 | Templars helped recapture; Acre became new Templar HQ |
| Fall of Acre | 1291 | Last major Crusader city falls; Templar Grand Master Guillaume de Beaujeu killed; End of Crusader States |

- Templars were elite heavy cavalry and fortification builders
- Non-retreat rule: Templars could not retreat unless outnumbered 3-to-1 or more (with Grand Master permission)
- Cross-shaped red cross (croix pattée) on white mantle was their identifying mark — granted by Pope Eugenius III (1147)

### 1.4 The Arrests and Trials (1307–1312) [1/5 sources]

**Timeline:**

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Sept 14, 1307 | Philip IV issues secret arrest orders |
| **Oct 13, 1307** | Simultaneous arrest of Templars across France — origin of "Friday the 13th" superstition |
| 1307–1310 | Trials, torture, forced confessions |
| 1308 | Pope Clement V tries to reclaim jurisdiction; sends papal commissioners |
| Aug 17–20, 1308 | **Chinon hearings** — Pope's cardinals hear Templar leaders' confessions privately |
| 1310 | 54 Templars burned alive at Paris for recanting forced confessions |
| 1312 | Council of Vienne: Clement V dissolves the Order (*Vox in Excelso*) — but does NOT condemn it as heretical |
| March 18, 1314 | Jacques de Molay (last Grand Master) and Geoffroi de Charny burned at the stake in Paris |

**Charges against the Templars (brought by Philip IV and the Inquisition):**
- Denying Christ and spitting/trampling on the cross during initiation
- Worshipping an idol called "Baphomet"
- Homosexual practices
- Financial corruption
- Secret dealings with Muslims

**Assessment of charges:**
- Confessions were extracted under TORTURE — multiple Templars recanted when not under duress
- The charges closely match template accusations used against OTHER groups Philip IV wanted to suppress (including Pope Boniface VIII)
- No physical evidence of idol worship was ever produced
- The simultaneous arrest of thousands of Templars across France suggests a coordinated political operation, not a genuine heresy investigation
- **Modern scholarly consensus (Tier 1):** The Templar suppression was primarily POLITICALLY motivated — Philip IV wanted their wealth and to eliminate a power center he couldn't control. The charges were fabricated or grossly exaggerated.

### 1.5 The Chinon Parchment (Discovered 2001, Published 2007) [1/5 sources]

- **Source:** Frale, Barbara. "The Chinon Chart: Papal Absolution to the Last Templar, Master Jacques de Molay." *Journal of Medieval History* 30(2), 2004; Vatican Secret Archives (ASV)
- **Discovery:** Barbara Frale, Italian paleographer, found the document misfiled in the Vatican Secret Archives in 2001
- **Content:** Records of a papal commission (August 17–20, 1308) at Chinon Castle where Pope Clement V's cardinals privately heard confessions from Jacques de Molay and other Templar leaders
- **Key finding:** The Pope ABSOLVED the Templar leadership of heresy
  - De Molay and others confessed to some charges (denying Christ during initiation) but described them as ritualistic/symbolic, not genuine acts of apostasy
  - The Pope accepted these explanations and granted absolution
  - The Pope then issued *Vox in Excelso* (1312) dissolving the Order — BUT the bull explicitly states the Order is being suppressed due to its damaged reputation, NOT because of proven heresy
- **Significance:** Proves that the Pope KNEW the heresy charges were not genuine but was pressured by Philip IV into suppressing the Order anyway. This is arguably the most significant medieval document discovery of the 21st century.

## 2. CREDIBLE CLAIMS (Tier 2 — Academic / Debated but Supported)

### 2.1 What Did the Templars Learn at the Temple Mount? [1/5 sources]

- **Source:** Ralls, Karen. *The Templars and the Grail*. Quest Books, 2003; various alternative accounts
- Templars were headquartered on the Temple Mount (1119–1187) — the site Jews, Christians, and Muslims associate with Solomon's Temple
- **Mainstream view (Tier 1):** They chose the location because it was offered by King Baldwin II of Jerusalem; it was a large, defensible compound. They used the Aqsa Mosque as headquarters and the underground "Solomon's Stables" as stabling for horses. No evidence of systematic excavation.
- **Alternative view (Tier 3):** Some authors (Christopher Knight, Robert Lomas; Graham Hancock) claim the Templars conducted secret excavations beneath the Temple Mount, discovering:
  - Lost treasures from Solomon's Temple
  - The Ark of the Covenant (Hancock, *The Sign and the Seal*, 1992)
  - Ancient scrolls or Gnostic/Hermetic texts
  - Sacred geometry knowledge that influenced their architectural program
- **Evidence for excavation:**
  - The Templar copper scroll connection: Some link the Copper Scroll from Qumran (A05) to Templar treasure hunting — this is **Tier 3–4** speculation with NO documentary evidence
  - Lt. Charles Wilson's 1867–1870 PEF survey found Templar artifacts (cross, spur, lance) in tunnels beneath the Temple Mount — evidence of PRESENCE, not systematic archaeological excavation
  - Israeli archaeologist Meir Ben-Dov found Templar-period structures in the area but no evidence of concealed knowledge
- **Assessment:** Templars were PRESENT on the Temple Mount for ~70 years. Whether they found anything besides stable space and water cisterns is **unknown and unverifiable** (Tier 2–3). The claim of hidden discoveries is unfalsifiable and primarily maintained by alternative authors.

### 2.2 Templar Maritime Power and the "Missing Fleet" [1/5 sources]

- **Source:** Various; Sinclair hypothesis
- After the Fall of Acre (1291), surviving Templars relocated to Cyprus, then spread across Europe
- Templars maintained naval facilities at La Rochelle (Atlantic France)
- The Templar fleet is mentioned in historical records but its fate after October 1307 is unclear
- **Counterargument:** Most Templars outside France were simply absorbed into other orders (especially the Knights Hospitaller). In Portugal, they were refounded as the Order of Christ (which later financed Portuguese Age of Exploration, including Vasco da Gama and Henry the Navigator — a REAL historical connection).
- **Note:** More speculative claims about the fleet (Sinclair expedition, Oak Island) are assessed under Tier 4 (see §4.2, §4.3).

### 2.3 Baphomet — What Was It? [1/5 sources]

- **Source:** Barber (1994); Ralls (2003); various studies on medieval trial testimony
- **The charge:** Templars allegedly worshipped an idol called "Baphomet" during secret ceremonies
- **Under torture, confessions varied wildly:**
  - A head (bearded, sometimes with two faces or three faces)
  - A cat
  - A skull
  - A reliquary with a human head inside
  - Some confessed to worshipping it; others denied any knowledge
- **Explanations (competing):**
  | Theory | Tier | Assessment |
  |--------|------|-----------|
  | **Fabrication by Philip IV** | 2 | Matches template accusations; inconsistent testimony suggests coaching |
  | **Corruption of "Mahomet" (Muhammad)** — charge of crypto-Islam | 2 | Philip accused them of Muslim sympathies; medieval French rendered "Muhammad" as "Mahomet" → "Baphomet" |
  | **Head reliquary tradition** — Christian relic veneration | 2 | Medieval reliquaries often contained saints' skulls; Templars may have had one |
  | **Atbash cipher (Schonfield)** — Baphomet = "Sophia" (Wisdom) in Hebrew cipher | 3 | Hugh Schonfield (*The Essene Odyssey*, 1984) applied Atbash cipher to "Baphomet" and derived "Sophia." Clever but unverifiable |
  | **Éliphas Lévi's goat-headed figure (1856)** | 1 (as history of the image) | Lévi's famous Baphomet illustration is a 19TH CENTURY creation, unrelated to medieval Templars |
- **Key point:** The famous goat-headed Baphomet image was created by Éliphas Lévi in *Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie* (1856) — over 500 years AFTER the Templar trials. It represents Lévi's occult philosophy (duality, equilibrium), NOT medieval Templar practice.

### 2.4 Friday the 13th — Origin Assessment [1/5 sources]

- **Popular claim:** The "Friday the 13th" superstition originates from the arrest of the Templars on Friday, October 13, 1307
- **Evidence:**
  - The arrest date IS Friday, October 13, 1307 — verified
  - However, the earliest documented reference to Friday the 13th as unlucky dates to the 19th century, NOT the 14th
  - Thomas W. Lawson's novel *Friday, the Thirteenth* (1907) popularized the superstition
  - The NUMBER 13 was considered unlucky earlier (Last Supper: 13 at table; Norse mythology: Loki as 13th guest)
  - Friday was considered unlucky independently (Jesus crucified on Friday)
- **Assessment:** The COMBINATION of Friday + 13th as specifically unlucky PROBABLY does NOT derive from the Templar arrests. The connection was popularized in the 20th century, likely retrojected onto the historical event. **Tier 2 for the coincidence; Tier 3 for the causal claim.**

---

## 3. SPECULATIVE CLAIMS (Tier 3 — Possible but Unverified)

### 3.1 The Holy Grail Connection [1/5 sources]

- **Source:** Wolfram von Eschenbach, *Parzival* (~1210)
- Wolfram von Eschenbach's *Parzival* (~1210) describes the Grail as guarded by "templeisen" (templars) — first literary connection
- *Parzival* calls the Grail "lapsit exillis" — variously interpreted as "lapis exilis" (small stone), "lapis ex coelis" (stone from heaven), or a garbled phrase
- **Mainstream view:** The Grail legend has pre-Christian Celtic roots (Cauldron of the Dagda, Cauldron of Bran); it was Christianized in the 12th century. The Templar connection is LITERARY, not historical.
- **Note:** The "Holy Blood" / "Sang Réal" bloodline theory based on Priory of Sion documents (confirmed forgeries) is assessed under Tier 4 (see §4.1).

### 3.2 Templar-Freemason Connection [1/5 sources]

- **Source:** Stevenson, David. *The Origins of Freemasonry: Scotland's Century, 1590–1710*. Cambridge, 1988; Robinson, John J. *Born in Blood*. 1989.
- **Claim:** After suppression, Templar survivors in Scotland merged with stonemason guilds, eventually becoming Freemasonry
- **Evidence cited:**
  - Scotland under Robert the Bruce was excommunicated (1306) — Templars may have found refuge there
  - Battle of Bannockburn (1314): legend that Templar cavalry charged at a critical moment (NO documentary evidence)
  - Rosslyn Chapel (built 1446 by William Sinclair): contains elaborate stone carvings, some allegedly showing Masonic/Templar symbols and disputed "New World" plants (see §4.4)
  - The Kirkwall Scroll: 15th or 18th century scroll with Masonic/Templar imagery
- **Counterarguments:**
  - Stevenson (1988): Freemasonry's documented origins are in SCOTTISH stonemason guilds of the 1590s — there is a 280-year gap between Templar suppression (1312) and earliest Masonic records
  - No documentary evidence of Templar survivors in Scotland forming any organization
  - The Masonic claim of Templar descent appeared CENTURIES after the facts, during a period of Masonic mythologizing (18th century)
- **Assessment:** Direct organizational continuity Templar → Freemason is **Tier 3** (possible but undocumented). Freemasons adopted Templar SYMBOLISM and MYTHOLOGY in the 18th century (Tier 1 — documented). See N02.

### 3.3 Templar Treasure [1/5 sources]

- **Where is the Templar treasury?**
  - At the time of arrests (Oct 13, 1307), the Paris Temple housed the French royal treasury AND the Templar treasury
  - Philip IV's men found the Paris Temple largely empty of treasure — suggesting advance warning and removal
  - **Proposed locations for hidden treasure:**
    - Transported to Scotland (see above)
    - Transported to Portugal (Order of Christ — Templars continued under different name)
    - Hidden in the Languedoc region of southern France (Rennes-le-Château legends)
    - Buried beneath or within various Templar commanderies
  - **Most likely:** Templar wealth was in property, not portable gold. Philip IV seized ~9,000 Templar properties across France. The "missing treasure" may be largely mythological — liquid assets were likely distributed before the arrests by forewarned leaders.
- **Note:** The Oak Island claim is assessed under Tier 4 (see §4.2).

### 3.4 Templar Connections to Eastern Knowledge [1/5 sources]

- Templars operated in the Levant for ~170 years (1119–1291)
- Contact with: Islamic scholars, Eastern Christian traditions (Orthodox, Coptic, Armenian), Sufi mystics, Jewish Kabbalists, Ismaili Assassins (Hashashins)
- **Documented interactions:**
  - Templar-Assassin relations: Multiple recorded contacts; truces, even alleged alliances. The Assassin fortress of Masyaf was near Templar territories. Whether knowledge exchange occurred is unknown.
  - Arabic loanwords in Templar documents suggest cultural contact
  - Templar architecture shows some Islamic influence (pointed arches, dome construction, geometric patterns)
- **Speculative (Tier 3):**
  - Templars acquired Sufi or Hermetic knowledge through Eastern contacts
  - Templar architectural programs encode sacred geometry learned from Islamic or Jewish sources (see D10)
  - The connection between Templar sites and astronomical alignments (ley lines — see O01)
- **Assessment:** Cultural exchange between Crusaders and Middle Eastern civilizations is WELL-DOCUMENTED (Tier 1). Whether Templars specifically acquired esoteric or "secret" knowledge is unverifiable (Tier 3).

---

## 4. DUBIOUS CLAIMS (Tier 4 — No Credible Source / Contradicted by Evidence)

### 4.1 Holy Blood / Royal Bloodline Theory [1/5 sources]

- **Source:** Baigent, Leigh & Lincoln, *The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail* (1982)
- **Claim:** The "Holy Grail" (Sangréal) = "Sang Réal" (Royal Blood) — a bloodline descended from Jesus and Mary Magdalene, allegedly protected by the Templars. This is the basis for Dan Brown's *The Da Vinci Code* (2004).
- **[DEBUNKED]** The "sang réal" etymology is WRONG — Old French "graal" = gradalis (a wide dish). The bloodline theory has NO documentary evidence. The Priory of Sion documents used as evidence were confirmed FORGERIES created by Pierre Plantard in 1956.

### 4.2 Oak Island Templar Treasure [1/5 sources]

- **Source:** Various alternative authors
- **Claim:** The Oak Island (Nova Scotia) "Money Pit" contains Templar treasure.
- **[DEBUNKED]** No credible evidence connects the Templars to Oak Island. The claim relies on speculative chains of reasoning with no documentary or archaeological support.

### 4.3 Sinclair Pre-Columbus Voyage to Americas [1/5 sources]

- **Source:** Sinclair hypothesis; various alternative authors
- **Claim:** The La Rochelle fleet escaped before the 1307 arrests and sailed to Scotland, Portugal, or even the Americas (pre-Columbus). The Sinclair expedition legend: Henry Sinclair (Earl of Orkney, 1345–~1400) allegedly voyaged to Nova Scotia ~1398, sometimes linked to Templar survivors.
- **Evidence cited:** The "Zeno Map" (likely a later fabrication) and carved markings at Westford, MA (debated).
- **[DEBUNKED]** The Zeno Map is likely a later fabrication. No documentary evidence supports a Templar-connected pre-Columbus trans-Atlantic voyage. The Westford Knight carving is heavily disputed and may be natural weathering.

### 4.4 Rosslyn Chapel "New World" Plant Carvings [1/5 sources]

- **Source:** Knight, C. & Lomas, R. *The Hiram Key*. Century, 1996; various alternative authors
- **Claim:** Rosslyn Chapel (built 1446) contains carvings of "New World" plants (maize, aloe), proving pre-Columbus contact with the Americas via Templar survivors.
- **[DEBUNKED]** The alleged "New World plants" are likely European plants (stylized wheat, etc.). Botanical identification of stylized medieval stone carvings is inherently unreliable.

## GAPS REMAINING

1. **What (if anything) did the Templars find under the Temple Mount?** The site has never been systematically excavated due to religious and political sensitivities. This question may never be answered.
2. **Were the Chinon absolutions known to Philip IV?** If so, his continued prosecution of the Templars despite papal absolution would confirm pure political motivation.
3. **Where did the Templar treasury go?** The Paris Temple was reportedly empty when Philip's men arrived. Did forewarned Templars remove assets?
4. **What happened to the La Rochelle fleet?** The Templar naval squadron disappears from records after October 1307.
5. **Order of Christ:** The Portuguese Templars were officially refounded as the Order of Christ (1319). Did they retain Templar knowledge, practices, or records? The Order of Christ's cross still flies on Portuguese monuments.
6. **Templar cipher systems:** Some Templar documents use a pigpen cipher (Maltese cross-based). Were more sophisticated ciphers used for sensitive communications?
7. **RECENT (2024–2026):** Have new documents been found in the Vatican Apostolic Archives (renamed from "Secret Archives" in 2019) related to the Templar trials? Needs web-access verification.
