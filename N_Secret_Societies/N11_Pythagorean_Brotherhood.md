## QUICK SUMMARY

Pythagoras of Samos (~570-495 BCE) was a Greek philosopher, mathematician, and mystic who founded a communal religious-philosophical society in the Greek colony of Croton (modern Calabria, southern Italy) around 530 BCE. This brotherhood functioned as what modern scholars recognize as a proto-secret society: members underwent years of silent initiation, were bound by strict rules of conduct and secrecy, and were divided into an outer circle of "listeners" (akousmatikoi) and an inner circle of "learners" (mathematikoi) who received the deeper teachings. The Pythagoreans discovered the mathematical ratios underlying musical harmony and extrapolated this into a cosmological principle — the "Music of the Spheres" — asserting that mathematical relationships governed the entire structure of the cosmos. Their sacred symbol, the tetractys (1+2+3+4=10), encoded their belief in the mystical significance of number. The Pythagorean model of initiation, secrecy, and numerological mysticism profoundly influenced Plato, the mystery school tradition, and virtually all subsequent Western esoteric movements.

## 1. VERIFIED CLAIMS (Tier 1 — Peer-Reviewed / Archaeological Record)

### 1.1 Pythagoras — Historical Figure
- Pythagoras was born on the island of Samos (eastern Aegean) around 570 BCE. Sources agree on his father's name (Mnesarchus, a gem-engraver) and his emigration to southern Italy.
- He traveled widely before establishing his school — ancient sources (of varying reliability) report visits to: Egypt (studying with priests at Memphis/Thebes), Babylon (learning Chaldean astronomy and mathematics), possibly Phoenicia, and possibly India.
- Around 530 BCE, he settled in **Croton** (a prosperous Greek colony in Magna Graecia, modern Calabria) and founded his philosophical community.
- The community attracted both men and women — Theano (often described as his wife or student) and several other women are named as members in ancient sources, remarkable for the era.
- **No writings survive from Pythagoras himself** — everything we know comes from later sources (Philolaus ~470-385 BCE, the earliest Pythagorean writer; Aristotle; later biographers Porphyry, Iamblichus, Diogenes Laertius).
- The destruction of the Pythagorean community occurred around 509-508 BCE (or later, accounts vary): a political uprising led by Cylon of Croton resulted in attacks on Pythagorean meeting houses and the expulsion or killing of members. Pythagoras may have died in Metapontum around 495 BCE.

### 1.2 Mathematical Discoveries
- **The Pythagorean Theorem:** while the relationship between the sides of a right triangle (a² + b² = c²) was known empirically to Babylonian mathematicians a millennium earlier (as evidenced by tablet Plimpton 322), the Pythagoreans are credited with formulating a general proof.
- **Musical ratios:** the discovery that harmonious musical intervals correspond to simple integer ratios is consistently attributed to Pythagoras:
  - Octave = 2:1
  - Fifth = 3:2
  - Fourth = 4:3
  - These were reportedly discovered by observing the relationship between string lengths and pitch on a monochord (single-stringed instrument).
- The traditional story of Pythagoras discovering these ratios by hearing harmonious and discordant sounds from a blacksmith's hammers of different weights is almost certainly apocryphal (the physics doesn't work for hammers), but the underlying discovery of mathematical ratios in music is genuine.
- **Number theory:** classification of numbers into even/odd, prime/composite, perfect numbers (6, 28, 496...), amicable numbers, figurate numbers (triangular, square, pentagonal).
- **Incommensurability (irrational numbers):** the discovery that √2 cannot be expressed as a ratio of whole numbers was a Pythagorean achievement that reportedly caused a crisis within the school, as it violated the principle that "all is number" (i.e., all things can be expressed as integer ratios).

### 1.3 Cosmological Contributions
- The **Music of the Spheres** (Musica Universalis): the Pythagorean cosmological principle that celestial bodies — Sun, Moon, planets, stars — are arranged at distances corresponding to musical intervals, and that their movements produce a cosmic harmony inaudible to ordinary humans.
- This was not merely metaphorical — the Pythagoreans genuinely believed mathematical ratios governed planetary distances and cosmic structure.
- **Spherical Earth:** Pythagoras (or early Pythagoreans) is among the first Greeks credited with recognizing the Earth is a sphere, based on observations of lunar eclipses, ships disappearing over the horizon, and the philosophical preference for the sphere as the most perfect geometric form.
- **Central fire cosmology:** later Pythagorean Philolaus proposed that Earth, Sun, Moon, and planets all orbit a central fire (not the Sun) — a non-geocentric model that predates and possibly influenced Aristarchus's heliocentric proposal.

## 2. CREDIBLE CLAIMS (Tier 2 — Academic / Debated but Supported)

### 2.1 Community Structure — Proto-Secret Society
- The Pythagorean community at Croton functioned as a communal living arrangement with strict rules governing conduct, diet, dress, and intellectual activity.
- **Initiation process:** new members reportedly underwent a **five-year period of silence** (echemythia) during which they could listen to Pythagoras's teachings from behind a curtain but could not ask questions or participate actively.
- After the silent period, successful candidates were admitted to the inner circle and could see Pythagoras face-to-face.
- **Two grades of membership:**
  - **Akousmatikoi** ("listeners"): the outer group, focused on practical rules, ethical precepts, and symbolism — they received teachings as authoritative pronouncements (akousmata = "things heard").
  - **Mathematikoi** ("learners"): the inner group, engaged in original mathematical and philosophical investigation, permitted to question and develop the doctrines.
- Secrecy oath: members were reportedly bound by an oath not to reveal the teachings to outsiders. The attribution of all discoveries to "the Master" (Pythagoras) regardless of who actually made them was part of this communal intellectual identity.
- Political engagement: the Pythagorean community at Croton became politically influential, effectively governing the city for a period — which ultimately provoked the backlash that destroyed them.

### 2.2 Doctrines and Rules (Akousmata)
- **Metempsychosis (transmigration of souls):** Pythagoras taught that the soul is immortal and undergoes a cycle of rebirths into human and animal bodies. This doctrine has parallels with Indian reincarnation beliefs (→ possible Eastern influence from his alleged travels).
- Pythagoras reportedly claimed to remember his own previous lives — including an incarnation as Euphorbus, a warrior at Troy.
- **Dietary rules:** vegetarianism (at least partially — sources disagree on strictness); abstention from certain foods including broad beans.
- **The bean taboo:** one of the most discussed Pythagorean peculiarities. Explanations proposed in antiquity and modernity include:
  - Resemblance to human organs (testicles, embryos, or kidneys)
  - Association with the dead (beans used in funerary offerings)
  - Flatulence (violation of bodily purity)
  - Favism (G6PD enzyme deficiency causing hemolytic anemia from fava bean consumption, common in Mediterranean populations — this modern medical explanation is anachronistic as a Pythagorean motivation but may reflect empirical observation)
  - Beans used in voting (democratic processes the Pythagoreans opposed?)
- **Daily practices:** self-examination (reviewing the day's actions before sleep), specific rituals for rising and retiring, communal meals, mathematical study, and musical practice.

### 2.3 Influence on Plato and Subsequent Tradition
- Plato visited Pythagorean communities in southern Italy (~387 BCE) and was profoundly influenced:
  - The Academy's emphasis on mathematics ("Let no one ignorant of geometry enter") echoes Pythagorean mathematical mysticism.
  - Plato's Theory of Forms (abstract, eternal mathematical entities underlying physical reality) is deeply Pythagorean in spirit.
  - The Timaeus (Plato's cosmological dialogue) is explicitly Pythagorean — featuring a Pythagorean narrator (Timaeus of Locri) and constructing the cosmos from mathematical proportions.
  - Plato's concept of anamnesis (learning as recollection from previous lives) parallels Pythagorean metempsychosis.
- Through Plato, Pythagorean ideas entered the mainstream of Western philosophy and science.
- The Pythagorean tradition continued through: Neopythagoreanism (1st century CE), Neoplatonism, medieval number mysticism, Renaissance Hermeticism, Freemasonry, and modern mathematical aesthetics.

## 3. SPECULATIVE CLAIMS (Tier 3 — Possible but Unverified)

### 3.1 Eastern Origins of Pythagorean Doctrines
- The parallels between Pythagorean metempsychosis and Indian karmic/reincarnation doctrines have led some scholars (most notably W.K.C. Guthrie and others) to propose direct influence—Pythagoras learning from Indian philosophers during his alleged travels.
- Contact routes existed: Persian Empire connected Greek Ionia to the Indian subcontinent; Scylax of Caryanda reportedly explored the Indus under Darius I (~515 BCE), contemporary with Pythagoras.
- Counter-arguments: metempsychosis could be an independent development; Greek orphic traditions already contained transmigration ideas; the chronology of Pythagoras's travels is poorly documented.
- Chinese and Egyptian parallels also exist, making the direction and degree of transmission uncertain.

### 3.2 The Sacred Tetractys and Numerological System
- The **tetractys** — a triangular arrangement of 10 dots (rows of 1, 2, 3, 4) — was the supreme sacred symbol of the Pythagorean brotherhood. Members reportedly swore oaths "by the tetractys."
- Significance: 1+2+3+4 = 10 (the decad, considered the perfect number); the four rows encode: point (1), line (2 points), plane (3 points), solid (4 points) — the full dimensionality of space; the four numbers also generate the musical intervals (1:2 = octave, 2:3 = fifth, 3:4 = fourth).
- Whether the full numerological system attributed to the Pythagoreans (odd = male/limited/good, even = female/unlimited/bad; specific number associations: 1 = reason, 2 = opinion, 3 = harmony, 4 = justice, 5 = marriage, etc.) was genuinely Pythagorean or later elaboration is debated.

---

## 4. DUBIOUS CLAIMS (Tier 4 — No Credible Source)

### 4.1 Supernatural Attributes
- Late ancient biographers (Iamblichus, Porphyry, 3rd century CE) attributed miraculous abilities to Pythagoras: being seen in two places simultaneously, having a golden thigh, being greeted by name by a river, conversing with animals.
- These are hagiographic embellishments typical of ancient philosophical biography and are not historically credible.

### 4.2 Unbroken Secret Lineage
- Claims that a continuous, secret Pythagorean lineage has persisted from the 5th century BCE to the present — transmitting hidden mathematical or spiritual knowledge — have no documentary evidence. Modern Pythagorean-inspired groups are revivalist, not continuous.
