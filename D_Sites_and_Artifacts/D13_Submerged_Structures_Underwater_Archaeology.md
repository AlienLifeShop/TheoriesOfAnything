## QUICK SUMMARY

Since the Last Glacial Maximum (~26,500–19,000 BP), global sea levels have risen approximately 120–130 meters, inundating an estimated 25 million km² of formerly habitable land — an area larger than North America. Any coastal or lowland civilizations from the Pleistocene or early Holocene would now be submerged. This document catalogs the most significant submerged archaeological sites worldwide, from verified ancient cities (Pavlopetri, Heracleion) to controversial formations (Yonaguni, Bimini Road). The geological FACT of post-glacial sea level rise is Tier 1; the implications for "lost civilizations" range from Tier 1 (verified submerged settlements) to Tier 3 (pre-ice-age civilization claims).

## 1. SEA LEVEL CONTEXT — THE 120-METER RISE

### 1.1 Post-Glacial Sea Level Rise — Verified Science (Tier 1)

- **Source:** Lambeck, K. et al. "Sea Level and Global Ice Volumes from the Last Glacial Maximum to the Holocene." *PNAS* 111(43), 2014; Peltier, W.R. et al. "Space geodesy constrains ice age terminal deglaciation." *Geophysical Research Letters* 42, 2015.
- **Key data:**
  - Last Glacial Maximum (LGM): ~26,500–19,000 BP; sea levels ~120–130 m below present
  - Meltwater Pulse 1A (~14,600 BP): ~16–25 m rise in ~500 years (catastrophic)
  - Meltwater Pulse 1B (~11,300 BP): ~7–10 m rise (debated timing, coincides with Younger Dryas end)
  - Sea levels reached roughly modern levels by ~6,000–4,000 BP
  - Rate was NOT uniform — pulses of rapid flooding separated by pauses
- **Implications:** Any human settlement on exposed continental shelves before ~10,000 BP would now be underwater. This includes the entire coastline of Africa, India, Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Americas.
- **Connection to C02 (Flood Stories):** Meltwater pulses provide geological basis for universal flood traditions. A 25 m rise in 500 years = ~5 cm/year = perceptible, catastrophic coastal flooding within human lifetimes.

### 1.2 Lost Landmasses — Verified (Tier 1)

| Landmass | Location | Submerged Area | Depth | Date Submerged | Pop. Evidence |
|----------|----------|---------------|-------|----------------|---------------|
| **Doggerland** | North Sea | ~23,000 km² | 20–50 m | ~6200 BCE (Storegga slide) | Extensive — tools, bones, settlements dredged by fishing trawlers |
| **Sundaland** | SE Asia | ~1,800,000 km² | 30–120 m | ~14,000–8,000 BCE | Stone tools, probable habitation sites; land bridge to Borneo/Java |
| **Beringia** | Bering Strait | ~1,600,000 km² | 30–50 m | ~11,000 BCE | Migration route for first Americans; verified by genetics |
| **Sahul Shelf** | N. Australia | ~2,500,000 km² | 50–130 m | ~12,000–8,000 BCE | Aboriginal settlement sites now submerged |
| **Persian Gulf Basin** | Arabian Gulf | ~800 km long | 30–100 m | ~8,000–6,000 BCE | Rose (2010): Gulf was habitable oasis during ice age |

- **Jeffrey Rose (2010):** "New Light on Human Prehistory in the Arabo-Persian Gulf Oasis." *Current Anthropology* 51(6). Proposed that the Persian Gulf floor was a fertile refuge during the ice age, with settlements now under 30–100 m of water. The sudden flooding of this "Gulf Oasis" (~8,000 BP) may underlie Sumerian flood myths.

## 2. VERIFIED SUBMERGED ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES — Tier 1

### 2.1 Pavlopetri, Greece — Oldest Known Submerged City

- **Location:** Laconia, southern Greece; 3–4 m depth
- **Source:** Henderson, J.C. et al. "Mapping Pavlopetri." *Internet Archaeology* 30, 2011; Gallou, C. & Henderson, J. "Pavlopetri, an Early Bronze Age harbour town in Laconia." *BSA Studies* forthcoming; Flemming, N.C. "Cities under the Sea." *The Geographic Journal* 137, 1971.
- **Discovery:** First identified by Nicholas Flemming (1967); systematic survey by Nottingham University (2009–2014)
- **Date:** ~5,000 BP (Early Bronze Age, ~3000 BCE); some ceramics suggest Neolithic occupation (~3500 BCE)
- **Features:**
  - Complete city plan visible on seabed: streets, buildings, courtyards, rock-cut tombs
  - At least 15 buildings, streets, 2 chamber tombs, area ~100,000 m²
  - Pottery: Neolithic to Late Bronze Age (suggests ~2,000 years of habitation)
  - No evidence of violent destruction; submersion due to seismic subsidence (tectonic)
- **Significance:** Proves that complete Bronze Age cities can survive underwater for 5,000 years; validates underwater archaeology as crucial for understanding early urbanization
- **Counterargument:** Pavlopetri is Bronze Age (~3000–1200 BCE), NOT pre-ice-age. Cannot be used to argue for extreme antiquity.

### 2.2 Heracleion (Thonis), Egypt — Lost Port of Egypt

- **Location:** Abu Qir Bay, near Alexandria, Egypt; 6–7 m depth
- **Source:** Goddio, Franck. *Sunken Egypt: Alexandria*. Periplus, 2004; Goddio, F. & Fabre, D. (eds). *Egypt's Sunken Treasures*. Prestel, 2006.
- **Discovery:** Franck Goddio / IEASM (Institut Européen d'Archéologie Sous-Marine), 2000
- **Date:** Founded ~8th century BCE; sank ~8th century CE (gradual subsidence + earthquake + flood)
- **Features:**
  - Massive temple of Amun-Gereb (god of Heracleion)
  - 64 ancient ships discovered in port basin
  - Gold coins, bronze statues, giant granite stelae (2.4 m / 8 ft)
  - The "Stele of Thonis" — bilingual decree confirming the city's Egyptian name (Thonis) = Greek name (Heracleion)
  - Naos of the Decades — astrological calendar monument
  - Intact religious artifacts including statues of Isis, Osiris, Hapi
- **Why it sank:** Combination of rising sea level, tectonic subsidence, soil liquefaction (the city was built on unstable Nile Delta sediments), and likely earthquake(s)
- **Ongoing excavation:** IEASM campaigns continue annually; new finds as recently as 2023 (military vessel, Greek burial area)
- **RECENT (2023–2024):** Goddio's team discovered a Greek sanctuary and additional naval vessels in the submerged canal; suggests the city was a major multinational trading hub.

### 2.3 Dwarka, India — Verified Underwater Ruins

- **Location:** Gulf of Kutch / Gulf of Cambay, Gujarat, India; 5–12 m depth (Dwarka Bay); 20–40 m depth (Gulf of Cambay claims)
- **Source:** Rao, S.R. *The Lost City of Dvaraka*. National Institute of Oceanography, 1999; Gaur, A.S. et al. "Underwater Exploration at Dwarka." *Man and Environment* 26(1), 2001.
- **Verified findings (Tier 1–2):**
  - Marine Archaeological Centre (NIO Goa) surveys from 1983–2005
  - Stone structures, anchors, pottery found offshore at Bet Dwarka and Dwarka
  - Structures include stone walls, bastions, and what appears to be a planned settlement
  - Pottery dates: Late Harappan / post-Harappan (~1500–1000 BCE)
  - An ancient jetty/wharf structure confirmed by NIOT surveys
- **Claims requiring caution (Tier 3):**
  - S.R. Rao identified the site with the legendary Dwarka of Krishna (Mahabharata)
  - Gulf of Cambay anomaly (2001): NIOT sonar detected geometric features at 20–40 m depth; claimed to be a 9,500-year-old city. However, many geologists argue these are **natural rock formations** (Rajendran & Rajendran, 2003)
  - Radiocarbon dated wood sample from Gulf of Cambay yielded ~9,500 BP — but provenance questioned (wood could be driftwood, not from structures)
- **Mainstream assessment:** Dwarka Bay structures ARE archaeological (Tier 1–2). Gulf of Cambay "city" is highly contested (Tier 3) — geological explanations exist for the formations.
- **Connection to traditions:** Mahabharata describes Dwarka as built by Vishwakarma for Krishna, later submerged by the sea after Krishna's departure. The EXISTENCE of ancient structures offshore is verified, but identification with the mythological Dwarka is interpretive.

### 2.4 Port Royal, Jamaica — Historical Verification

- **Location:** Kingston Harbour, Jamaica; 2–15 m depth
- **Date:** Sank June 7, 1692 (earthquake + liquefaction)
- **Source:** Hamilton, D.L. *Port Royal Project* (Texas A&M); Pawson, M. & Buisseret, D. *Port Royal, Jamaica*. UWI Press, 2000.
- **Features:** "Wickedest city on Earth" — pirate haven, Caribbean trading center; preserved in situ by rapid burial in liquefied sand. Buildings, streets, artifacts (watches stopped at 11:43 AM), human remains; over 2,000 killed.
- **Significance:** Demonstrates how rapidly and completely a city can be submerged; provides archaeological baseline for studying submerged urbanism.

## 3. CONTROVERSIAL / DEBATED SITES — Tier 2–3

### 3.1 Yonaguni Monument, Japan

- **Location:** Off Yonaguni Island, Ryukyu Islands, Japan; 5–25 m depth
- **Discovery:** Kihachiro Aratake (diver), 1987
- **Source:** Kimura, Masaaki. "Diving Survey Report for Submarine Ruins Off Yonaguni, Japan." *Marine Science and Technology* 12(3), 2004; Schoch, Robert M. "An Enigmatic Ancient Underwater Structure off the Coast of Yonaguni Island, Japan." *Circular Times*, 1999; Geological Society of Japan, response papers.
- **Pro-artificial arguments (Kimura — Tier 3):**
  - Right-angle terraces, flat platforms, apparent stairways
  - Two "pillars," "roadway," tunnel-like features
  - "Stadium" or amphitheater-like enclosure
  - A feature called "the turtle" resembling a carved animal
  - Kimura dates construction to ~10,000 BP (based on when the area was above sea level)
  - If artificial: implies organized, stone-working civilization in Japan during the late Pleistocene
- **Pro-natural arguments (Geological mainstream — Tier 1):**
  - Yonaguni geology: mudstone and sandstone with natural tendency to fracture along right angles (orthogonal jointing)
  - The flat terraces, sharp edges, and step-like features can ALL be explained by natural erosion along bedding planes
  - No tool marks, no mortar, no carved inscriptions found
  - Other exposed rock formations on Yonaguni ABOVE water show identical step-like fracturing
  - Schoch (initially sympathetic) later acknowledged strong natural formation arguments but noted some features "difficult to explain" geologically
- **Balanced assessment:** The monument's most distinctive features (terraces, steps, flat surfaces) are consistent with known geological processes in layered sedimentary rock. However, some features (possible channel carving, a triangular depression) remain debated. **Most geologists consider it natural (Tier 1 evidence); artificial claims remain Tier 3.**
- **Images available:** Abundant underwater photography — Wikimedia Commons has several CC-licensed images of the terraces and "steps."

### 3.2 Bimini Road, Bahamas

- **Location:** North Bimini Island, Bahamas; 3–9 m depth
- **Discovery:** 1968; linked to Edgar Cayce's 1938 prophecy about Atlantis rising "near Bimini"
- **Source:** McKusick, M. & Shinn, E.A. "Bahamian Atlantis Reconsidered." *Nature* 287, 1980; Harrison, W. "Atlantis Undiscovered: Bimini, Bahamas." *Nature* 230, 1971; Shinn, E.A. "Geology and History of the Bimini Road." *GSA Bulletin*, 2004.
- **Structure:** Linear arrangement of large rectangular limestone blocks, ~600 m long, in J-shape or double line
- **Pro-artificial arguments (Tier 3–4):**
  - David Zink and others claimed blocks were deliberately placed, forming a road, wall, or harbor structure
  - Some blocks appear to have tongue-and-groove joints
  - Alignment suggests intentional placement
  - Cayce prophecy connection used to argue for Atlantean origin
- **Debunking (Tier 1 — definitive):**
  - McKusick & Shinn (1980, *Nature*): Blocks are **beachrock** — naturally cemented coastal sand
  - Radiocarbon dating of the rock: ~2,000–3,500 BP (far too young for ice-age civilization)
  - Block undersides show no evidence of foundation preparation
  - Identical beachrock formations found at other Bahamian locations
  - "Tongue-and-groove" joints are natural weathering patterns in beachrock
  - Shinn (2004): Detailed geological study confirming natural origin; blocks fractured in place from a single slab
- **Verdict:** Bimini Road is **natural beachrock** (Tier 1 debunking). The Cayce prophecy connection is Tier 4.

### 3.3 Cuban Underwater Anomaly

- **Location:** Guanahacabibes Peninsula, western Cuba; ~600–750 m depth
- **Source:** Zelitsky, Paulina & Weinzweig, Paul. Advanced Digital Communications (ADC) sonar survey, 2001; National Geographic coverage, 2002.
- **Claims (Tier 3):**
  - Side-scan sonar and ROV footage revealed apparent geometric structures at extreme depth
  - Zelitsky reported features resembling pyramids, rectangles, and roads
  - If artificial: would need to date to >50,000 BP (when area was last above sea level due to tectonic subsidence + sea level)
  - This would predate ALL known human civilizations by tens of thousands of years
- **Problems (Tier 1 counterarguments):**
  - Depth of 600–750 m CANNOT be explained by sea level rise alone (max ~130 m) — would require massive tectonic subsidence
  - No follow-up peer-reviewed geological survey has confirmed artificial structures
  - National Geographic funded a follow-up but results were inconclusive
  - Sonar imaging at that depth can produce misleading geometric patterns from natural features
  - No artifacts or cultural material recovered from the site
- **Status:** Intriguing but UNVERIFIED. No peer-reviewed publication has confirmed artificial structures. The extreme depth makes ice-age submersion implausible without extraordinary tectonic events. **Tier 3 at best; possibly Tier 4.**

### 3.4 Nan Madol, Pohnpei (Micronesia) — Above Water but Relevant

- **Location:** Pohnpei Island, Federated States of Micronesia; partially submerged, sea-level site
- **Source:** McCoy, M.D. et al. "Earliest Direct Evidence of Monument Building at Nan Madol." *Quaternary Research* 86(2), 2016; Hanlon, D. *Upon a Stone Altar*. University of Hawaiʻi Press, 1988.
- **Features:**
  - 92 artificial islands built on a coral reef flat, covering ~80 hectares
  - Constructed from prismatic basalt columns (naturally formed, stacked like Lincoln Logs)
  - Estimated 750,000 metric tons of basalt moved from quarries up to 50 km away
  - Nandowas tomb — largest structure, walls up to 7.6 m (25 ft) tall
  - Construction began ~1100 CE (radiocarbon confirmed); peak construction ~1200–1500 CE
- **Mysteries:**
  - How ~25,000 people (estimated island population) moved 750,000 tons of basalt without metal tools, wheels, or draft animals
  - Local oral tradition: the twin sorcerers Olisihpa and Olosohpa used magic to fly the stones into place
  - Some structures are now partially submerged due to slight sea level changes and island subsidence
- **Connection to project:** Nan Madol demonstrates that "impossible" megalithic construction WAS accomplished by premodern peoples with limited technology — cautionary tale against assuming alien/advanced intervention for every megalithic site (see D05, M03).
- **UNESCO World Heritage Site** (2016); also placed on "in Danger" list due to environmental threats.

### 3.5 Atlit-Yam, Israel — Submerged Neolithic Village

- **Location:** Off Atlit, Haifa coast, Israel; 8–12 m depth
- **Source:** Galili, E. & Rosen, B. "Submerged Neolithic Settlements off the Carmel Coast, Israel." *Paléorient* 34(1), 2008; Galili, E. et al. "Atlit-Yam: A Prehistoric Site on the Sea Floor off the Israeli Coast." *Journal of Field Archaeology* 20(2), 1993.
- **Date:** ~9,000 BP (~7000 BCE) — Pre-Pottery Neolithic C
- **Features:**
  - Stone-built houses, storage facilities, a freshwater well (one of the oldest known)
  - Megalithic stone semicircle (ritual/ceremonial)
  - Skeletal remains — including earliest known cases of **tuberculosis** (mother and infant with M. tuberculosis DNA)
  - Plant remains (flax, barley, wheat, lentils) showing early agriculture
  - Animal bones showing pastoralism (cattle, pigs, dogs)
  - Stone tools, fish hooks, bone artifacts
- **Submersion:** Rising Mediterranean sea level (~7000–6300 BCE); possibly accelerated by tsunami (Storegga slide, ~6200 BCE)
- **Significance:** Well-preserved Neolithic village demonstrating advanced settlement patterns at 9,000 BP. Shows that some of the earliest agricultural communities were coastal — and are now underwater.

### 3.6 Cambay / Khambhat (Gulf of Cambay), India

- **Location:** Gulf of Cambay/Khambhat, Gujarat, India; 20–40 m depth
- **Source:** Gupta, S.P. "The Lost Saraswati and the Indus Civilization." Jodhpur, 2001; Kathiroli, S. et al. National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) reports, 2001–2004; Rajendran, C.P. & Rajendran, K. "Geological evidences of paleoseismicity." *Current Science* 85, 2003.
- **Claims (Tier 3):**
  - NIOT side-scan sonar (2001) detected geometric "city-like" structures at 20–40 m depth
  - Dredged artifacts: pottery, beads, a micro-blade, carved stone, a piece of wood (C14: ~9,500 BP)
  - Interpreted by NIOT as evidence of a 9,500-year-old city predating the Indus Valley Civilization by 4,000 years
- **Critique (Tier 1–2):**
  - Sonar data has NOT been independently verified or published in peer-reviewed geological journals
  - "Artifacts" may be naturally occurring or washed in from elsewhere (strong tidal currents in Gulf of Cambay)
  - Wood sample dating tells us about the wood, not about any structure
  - Several geologists argued the sonar "structures" are natural geological formations (channel deposits, erosion patterns)
  - No systematic excavation has been conducted — only dredging, which destroys context
- **Status:** Genuinely intriguing sonar data, but **absence of peer-reviewed confirmation keeps this at Tier 3**. Requires proper underwater excavation (not dredging) to resolve.

## 4. SUBMERGED LANDSCAPES AND CONTINENTAL SHELF ARCHAEOLOGY

### 4.1 Doggerland — Europe's Lost Country (Tier 1)

- **Source:** Gaffney, V. et al. *Europe's Lost World: The Rediscovery of Doggerland*. CBA, 2009; Walker, J. et al. "A Great Wave: The Storegga Tsunami and the End of Doggerland?" *Antiquity* 94(378), 2020.
- **Location:** North Sea, between Britain and continental Europe
- **Area:** ~23,000 km² (larger than the Netherlands); connected Britain to mainland Europe until ~6500 BCE
- **Evidence:**
  - Fishing trawlers have dredged Mesolithic artifacts for over a century: stone tools, bone harpoons, human remains, worked antler
  - Seismic survey data reveals ancient river systems, lake margins, coastlines
  - *Europe's Lost World* project (Gaffney): 3D mapping of Doggerland's terrain from oil industry seismic data
  - Animal remains: mammoths, woolly rhinos, elk, aurochs → rich ecosystem
  - The "Doggerland Man" — Mesolithic human skull dredged from the North Sea
- **Destruction:** Final inundation likely caused/accelerated by Storegga Slide tsunami (~6200 BCE) — undersea landslide off Norway generated 20+ m tsunami waves
- **Significance:** Doggerland was not marginal — it was the CENTER of Mesolithic Northwest Europe, a resource-rich lowland. Its flooding displaced populations into Britain and Scandinavia.

### 4.2 Sundaland — Southeast Asian Lost Continent (Tier 1)

- **Source:** Oppenheimer, Stephen. *Eden in the East: The Drowned Continent of Southeast Asia*. Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1998; Pelejero, C. et al. "Preboreal Sea-Level Rise." *Nature* 477, 2011.
- **Location:** Southeast Asia; exposed shelf connected mainland Asia to Borneo, Java, Sumatra, and the Philippines
- **Area:** ~1,800,000 km² — larger than currently exposed Southeast Asia
- **Key points:**
  - During LGM: vast lowland savanna and forest; major river systems
  - Genetic evidence suggests Southeast Asia was a major population center during the Pleistocene
  - Oppenheimer thesis: Sundaland flooding (~14,000–5000 BCE) drove population dispersals into Indonesia, Polynesia, and possibly as far as Madagascar
  - Hoabinhian tool tradition found across current Southeast Asia originated in Sundaland
- **Connection to project:** Sundaland's flooding provides potential origin for Southeast Asian flood myths (C02) and may explain the widespread Naga traditions (C06, C11) — if Sundaland was the homeland of Naga-worshipping cultures.

### 4.3 Persian Gulf Oasis Hypothesis (Tier 2)

- **Source:** Rose, Jeffrey I. "New Light on Human Prehistory in the Arabo-Persian Gulf Oasis." *Current Anthropology* 51(6), 2010.
- **Hypothesis:** During the ice age, the Persian Gulf floor was an exposed, fertile river valley — a "Gulf Oasis" fed by the Tigris, Euphrates, Karun, and Wadi Batin rivers
- **Evidence:**
  - Geological mapping shows ancient river channels on the Gulf floor
  - Abrupt appearance of advanced Ubaid-period settlements around the Gulf's rim ~7,500 BP — refugees from the flooding oasis?
  - Some of the earliest Neolithic sites ring the Gulf coastline, suggesting prior habitation in the now-submerged center
- **Connection to Sumerian traditions:** The flooding of this oasis (~8,000–6,000 BP) may be the historical kernel behind Sumerian flood narratives (Eridu Genesis, Atra-Hasis, Gilgamesh Tablet XI) — see A01, C02.

---

## 5. SPECULATIVE CLAIMS AND COUNTERARGUMENTS

### 5.1 "Lost Civilization" Hypothesis (Tier 3)

- **Proponents:** Graham Hancock (*Underworld: The Mysterious Origins of Civilization*, 2002), Randall Carlson, Robert Schoch
- **Claim:** A sophisticated pre-ice-age civilization existed on now-submerged continental shelves; its destruction by flooding gave rise to Atlantis and other myths
- **Evidence cited:**
  - 25 million km² of habitable land submerged → possible lost population centers
  - Göbekli Tepe (D01) appeared "from nowhere" at end of ice age → survivors teaching hunter-gatherers?
  - Common flood myths worldwide (C02) → memory of real catastrophic flooding
  - Precession knowledge in ancient cultures (E04) → suggests deep-time astronomical observation
- **Counterarguments (Tier 1):**
  - No artifacts of an advanced civilization have been found on any submerged shelf, despite extensive offshore survey for oil, gas, and telecommunications
  - Göbekli Tepe shows evolutionary precursors at nearby sites (Karahan Tepe, Boncuklu Tarla — D01)
  - Flood myths can be explained by local flooding events without requiring global coordination
  - The archaeological record shows GRADUAL development of complexity, not sudden appearance
  - Hancock's "fingerprints" (precision, astronomy, megalithic construction) can each be explained by independent development
- **Note:** The HYPOTHESIS that submerged shelves MAY contain undiscovered sites is REASONABLE (Tier 2). The CLAIM that they contained an advanced civilization comparable to later Bronze Age societies is SPECULATIVE (Tier 3) and unsubstantiated by evidence.

### 5.2 Underwater Pyramids Claims (Tier 4)

- Multiple claims circulate about "underwater pyramids" in Bermuda Triangle, off Japan, near the Azores, and in the Pacific
- **Assessment:** Most are misinterpretations of sonar data, natural geological formations (seamounts, volcanic features), or outright fabrications
- **Bermuda Triangle "pyramid":** No credible sonar data supports this; viral internet claims lack source documentation
- **Azores "pyramid" (2013):** Portuguese Navy investigated; found to be a natural seamount (volcanic cone); no artificial features confirmed

## 7. CROSS-CULTURAL CONNECTIONS

- **Flood myths (C02, C03):** Nearly every culture with coastal traditions has flood narratives that may encode real memories of post-glacial sea level rise — Sumerian Eridu Genesis, Hebrew Genesis 6–9, Hindu Manu, Greek Deucalion, Hopi emergence stories
- **Serpent/water connections (C03, B03):** Many submerged-city myths feature serpent or Naga guardians of underwater realms (Indian Nagaloka, Chinese Dragon Palaces, Greek Poseidon's sea-serpents)
- **Atlantis (F01):** Plato's Atlantis narrative (Timaeus/Critias) describes a civilization destroyed by cataclysm and submerged — parallels real submersion events, though no single site matches the full description
- **Pacific traditions (C07):** Aboriginal Australian oral histories describe places now underwater (e.g., sea country off the Great Barrier Reef); these oral traditions may preserve 7,000+ year-old memories of real coastline changes (Nunn & Reid, 2015)
- **Mesopotamian origins (A01, A07):** If the Persian Gulf Oasis hypothesis is correct, the Apkallu tradition of beings emerging from the sea to teach civilization may encode memory of refugees from the flooded Gulf

## 10. OPEN QUESTIONS

1. **Continental shelf surveys:** Have oil/gas industry seismic surveys of continental shelves been systematically checked for potential archaeological features? Most surveys were NOT designed to detect small-scale human structures.
2. **Sundaland archaeology:** Can underwater surveys in the shallow Java Sea identify Hoabinhian or earlier occupation sites?
3. **Gulf of Cambay:** Will a proper underwater excavation (not dredging) ever be conducted to resolve the controversy?
4. **Doggerland habitation density:** Was Doggerland more densely populated than current estimates suggest? New seismic data from North Sea wind farm surveys may reveal more.
5. **Acoustic/LiDAR survey of shallow shelves worldwide:** A systematic program to survey the world's continental shelves at 0–130 m depth for archaeological features does not exist. This is the largest unexplored archaeological frontier on Earth.
6. **Cuban anomaly:** Will the site receive peer-reviewed geological/archaeological investigation?
7. **Storegga slide equivalent events:** Were there other submarine landslides that catastrophically flooded inhabited coastlines? (Candidates: Agulhas Shelf, Sunda Shelf)
