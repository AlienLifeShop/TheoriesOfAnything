## QUICK SUMMARY

One of the most puzzling cross-cultural motifs in ancient art: a "handbag" or bucket-shaped object appears in the hands of divine and semi-divine beings across civilizations separated by thousands of miles and thousands of years. Assyrian Apkallu hold the **banduddû** (sacred bucket) at Nimrud and Khorsabad (9th–7th century BCE). Göbekli Tepe's Pillar 43 displays three handbag-shaped objects above animal reliefs (~9600 BCE). Olmec stone figures at La Venta carry identical-looking objects (~900 BCE). Maori tradition describes three **kete** (baskets) of knowledge brought from the heavens by the god Tāne. Sumerian ME were described as physical objects that could be carried and even stolen — as in the myth of Inanna stealing the ME from Enki and loading them onto her boat.

The motif's consistency is remarkable: a rectangular or trapezoidal body with a curved or arched handle on top, held in one hand by a figure of authority or divinity. The cultures in question — Neolithic Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Mesoamerica, and Polynesia — had no documented contact with one another. This raises a fundamental question: **Is the worldwide handbag motif coincidence, cultural diffusion from a forgotten source, convergent design (bags being a universally obvious tool shape), or evidence of a shared antediluvian civilizational origin?**

No scholarly consensus currently exists. Mainstream Assyriologists have robust explanations for the Mesopotamian banduddû (ritual purification bucket used alongside the mullilu pine cone sprinkler). But the appearance of virtually the same form at Göbekli Tepe — some 7,000 years earlier and on a different continent — has no established conventional explanation.

## 1. VERIFIED CLAIMS (Tier 1)

These claims are well-documented in academic literature, museum collections, and archaeological reports.

### 1.1 Assyrian Apkallu Reliefs — The Banduddû

- **Nimrud (ancient Kalhu), 883–859 BCE:** The Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II contains dozens of carved stone panels depicting winged human-headed figures (Apkallu) and eagle-headed figures (griffin-genies) holding a bucket in one hand and a pine cone–shaped object (mullilu) in the other. These reliefs are extensively documented and currently held in the **British Museum** (London), **Metropolitan Museum of Art** (New York), **Louvre** (Paris), and numerous other institutions worldwide.
- **Khorsabad (Dur-Sharrukin), 721–705 BCE:** The palace of Sargon II features similar winged guardian figures with banduddû and mullilu, now primarily in the Louvre and the Oriental Institute (Chicago).
- **Dur-Sharrukin Gate Guardians:** Monumental lamassu (human-headed winged bulls) flanked by Apkallu figures carrying the bucket-and-cone combination.
- **Standard Assyriological interpretation:** The banduddû is a **ritual purification bucket** — essentially a container for liquid (water, oil, or sacred mixture) used in apotropaic (evil-averting) ceremonies. The mullilu (pine cone) served as a sprinkler. Figures dip the mullilu into the banduddû and sprinkle liquid to purify the king, the palace, or sacred spaces.
- **Textual confirmation:** Akkadian ritual texts describe purification ceremonies (bīt rimki — "bathhouse" rituals) involving water containers. The term *banduddû* appears in Neo-Assyrian lexical lists.
- **Museum catalog numbers:** British Museum BM 124531 (eagle-headed Apkallu from Nimrud, Room G, Panel 1); Met 32.143.3; Louvre AO 19857 — all photographed and published extensively.

### 1.2 Göbekli Tepe — Pillar 43 Handbags

- **Location:** Enclosure D, Göbekli Tepe, southeastern Turkey (Şanlıurfa Province). Excavated by Klaus Schmidt (German Archaeological Institute) beginning 1995.
- **Pillar 43 (the "Vulture Stone"):** The western central pillar of Enclosure D displays a complex carved scene: three **handbag-shaped objects** sit in a row along the top of the pillar, above a series of animal figures including a vulture with a circle (ball/sphere) on its wing, a scorpion, and other creatures.
- **Dating:** Radiocarbon dating of Göbekli Tepe's earliest layers (Layer III, which includes Enclosure D) places construction at approximately **9600–8200 BCE**, making these carvings approximately 11,600 years old — the oldest known handbag motifs in the world.
- **Physical description:** Each handbag carving consists of a roughly rectangular body with a curved semicircular arch or handle on top. The three objects are arranged side by side in a horizontal row. They are incised into the limestone pillar surface at a depth of several millimeters.
- **Undisputed observation:** The carvings exist and are photographed, measured, and published in peer-reviewed literature (Schmidt 2006, 2012; Dietrich et al. 2012). Their resemblance to the "handbag" form is noted by researchers and visitors alike, though interpretation varies.
- **Conventional interpretations include:** architectural representations (stylized buildings or dwelling), cosmograms representing celestial divisions, or purely decorative/symbolic elements whose meaning is unknown.

### 1.3 Olmec La Venta Figures

- **Location:** La Venta, Tabasco, Mexico. A major Olmec ceremonial center flourishing from approximately **900–400 BCE**.
- **Monument 19:** A bas-relief depicting a figure (interpreted as a priest or ruler) seated within the jaws of a feathered serpent, holding a **bag-like object** in one hand. Currently in the Parque-Museo La Venta, Villahermosa.
- **Stela and figurine evidence:** Multiple Olmec jade figurines and stone carvings show figures carrying small rectangular or trapezoidal bags with handles. These are documented in publications by the National Museum of Anthropology (Mexico City) and in Coe & Diehl (1980), *In the Land of the Olmec*.
- **Conventional interpretation:** Ritual pouches or medicine bags containing sacred objects (jade, rubber balls, incense, or ritual implements). Bags are common in Mesoamerican priestly iconography.

### 1.4 Maori Kete — Baskets of Knowledge

- **Tradition:** In Māori cosmology, the god **Tāne** (Tāne-nui-a-Rangi) ascended to the highest of the twelve heavens to obtain three **kete** (baskets) of knowledge from Io, the supreme being.
- **The three kete are:**
  - **Te Kete Tuauri** — the basket of sacred/esoteric knowledge (knowledge of ritual, prayer, and the spiritual world)
  - **Te Kete Tuatea** — the basket of ancestral knowledge (prayers, incantations, genealogy)
  - **Te Kete Aronui** — the basket of worldly knowledge (knowledge of the natural world, agriculture, arts, crafts)
- **Source attestation:** Recorded in multiple 19th-century ethnographic collections (Elsdon Best, *The Whare Wānanga*, 1923; S. Percy Smith transcriptions of Māori oral tradition). The tradition is broadly attested across iwi (tribal) groups, though details vary.
- **Physical form:** The kete is a woven flax basket — a fundamental object in Māori material culture. The metaphor of knowledge as something *contained and carried* is central to the tradition.

### 1.5 Sumerian ME as Physical Objects

- **The Myth of Inanna and Enki:** In this Sumerian composition (known from tablets dating to the Old Babylonian period, ~1800 BCE, but describing events/stories of much earlier origin), the goddess Inanna travels to the city of Eridu, gets the god Enki drunk, and steals the **ME** — the divine laws/powers/civilizational gifts — from him. Crucially, the ME are described as **physical objects that can be picked up, loaded onto a boat, and transported**.
- **The ME as a list:** In the myth, over 100 ME are enumerated, including kingship, priesthood, truth, the descent to the underworld, music, metalworking, sexual intercourse, and many more.
- **Text attestation:** Multiple cuneiform tablets, translated by Samuel Noah Kramer (1963), Bendt Alster, and ETCSL (Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature) — see ETCSL composition 1.3.1.
- **Physical container implication:** The narrative requires ME to be things that *fit inside a container* on a boat. This directly connects to the "knowledge container" concept.

### 1.6 Toltec and Aztec — Quetzalcoatl with Bags

- **Tula (Tollan):** The famous Atlantean warrior columns at Tula, Hidalgo, Mexico (~900–1168 CE) depict large warrior figures holding objects interpreted as **atlatl (spear-throwers)** and **bags or pouches** at their sides.
- **Codex Borgia and other Mesoamerican codices:** Quetzalcoatl (Feathered Serpent) and other deities are depicted with bag-like objects, medicine bundles, or copal incense pouches.
- **Conventional interpretation:** Incense bags (copal pouches), medicine bundles, or warrior equipment (projectile holders).

### 1.7 Egyptian Handled Objects

- **Ankh:** While not a "bag," the ankh (☥) is a looped cross that functions as a handled symbol — gods are depicted holding it by the loop, extending it toward pharaohs to confer life. Its origin as a physical object (sandal strap? mirror? knot?) remains debated.
- **Was scepter and djed pillar:** Other hand-held divine objects carried by Egyptian gods, representing power and stability respectively.
- **Naos sistrum:** Hathor's priestesses carry handled ritual instruments.
- **Note:** The Egyptian examples are more tangential — the parallels to the "handbag" form are weaker than Mesopotamian–Göbekli Tepe–Olmec examples.

---

## 2. CREDIBLE BUT DEBATED (Tier 2)

These interpretations are discussed in academic or serious research contexts but lack consensus.

### 2.1 Pillar 43 as Cosmogram or Astronomical Encoding

- **Sweatman & Tsikritsis (2017):** Published in *Mediterranean Archaeology and Archaeometry*, this paper argues Pillar 43 encodes an astronomical event — specifically the date of the Younger Dryas impact (~10,950 BCE) using precession-based star positions. Under this interpretation, the three "handbags" represent **three positions of the sun on the ecliptic** or three key celestial configurations.
- **Debate:** The paper was peer-reviewed but has been criticized for over-interpreting ambiguous carvings. Archaeoastronomical readings of Göbekli Tepe remain contested (see Notroff, Dietrich & Schmidt 2016 for skeptical responses).
- **Paul Engert's analysis** extends this line, arguing the three handbags are cosmograms representing divisions of the cosmos (sky, earth, underworld) — a tripartite model found in many ancient cosmologies.

### 2.2 Cross-Cultural Connection vs. Convergent Design

- **Diffusionist argument:** The visual similarity is too specific to be coincidental — a rectangular body with an arched handle is not the only way to depict a bag. The consistent association with divine/semi-divine figures, knowledge transfer, and purification strengthens the case for connection.
- **Convergent design argument:** A bag with a handle is one of the simplest and most practical container designs. Any culture that makes baskets or bags will independently arrive at a similar form. The handle-on-top design is ergonomically obvious.
- **Middle-ground position:** Some scholars (e.g., Graham Hancock in *Magicians of the Gods*, 2015) argue for a lost common source — a pre-catastrophe civilization that disseminated symbols globally before the Younger Dryas boundary event (~10,800 BCE). This is a minority position in academic archaeology.

### 2.3 The Banduddû as More Than a Ritual Bucket

- **Standard view:** An aqua manile — a water container for ritual aspersion (sprinkling), parallel to later Christian holy water practices.
- **Alternative view:** Some researchers argue the banduddû may have had a deeper symbolic meaning beyond practical purification — representing the "waters of life," cosmic abundance, or divine knowledge in liquid form. The Apkallu are wisdom-bringers (cf. A07 — Apkallu), so their bucket may contain *knowledge* rather than merely *water*.
- **Linguistic note:** The Sumerian term *banduddû* (Akkadian *banduddu*) literally translates to something like "bucket" or "pail." No hidden or esoteric meaning is apparent in the etymology, though the ritual context elevates the object beyond its mundane meaning.

### 2.4 Olmec Object Identification

- **Debate over what the Olmec figures hold:** The objects have been variously identified as:
  - Ritual bags or pouches (containing jade, incense, rubber)
  - Small helmets or head coverings
  - Containers for hallucinogenic substances (psilocybin mushrooms, morning glory seeds, toad venom — Bufo alvarius)
  - Stylized representations of jaguar pelts
- **Context matters:** Many Olmec figures holding these objects also display other markers of elite or divine status — elaborate headdresses, jaguar imagery, and cross-legged "lotus" sitting positions.

### 2.5 Situla Tradition — Bronze and Iron Age Europe

- **Situlae:** Bronze bucket-shaped vessels produced throughout the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures (central Europe, ~800–300 BCE). These decorated metal containers show feasting and ritual scenes and were associated with elite burial rites.
- **Connection to Mesopotamian banduddû:** Some art historians trace the European situla tradition to Near Eastern influence — the bucket form traveling westward through Phoenician and Greek intermediaries.
- **Relevance:** Demonstrates that the "sacred bucket" concept persisted and migrated across cultures within the documented historical record, making broader diffusion plausible.

---

## 3. SPECULATIVE (Tier 3)

These concepts are found in alternative research, ancient astronaut theory, and fringe scholarship. They lack mainstream academic support but are included for completeness.

### 3.1 Handbags as Portable Technology

- **Ancient astronaut interpretation (Sitchin, von Däniken, Childress):** The handbag-shaped objects are **portable technological devices** — possibly power sources, communication devices, or biological scanners. The consistent grip-and-carry posture suggests functional use rather than symbolic display.
- **Counter-argument:** No physical artifact matching this description has ever been recovered. All known banduddû-type objects are mundane containers (metal buckets, stone basins, woven baskets).

### 3.2 ME as Software in Physical Containers

- **Digital analogy:** The Sumerian ME are sometimes compared to **software programs** stored on physical media — the ME are "civilization codes" that, when loaded into a city, activate its functions (kingship, law, music, etc.). The container is the "hardware" (storage device); the ME are the "software."
- **Supporters:** This analogy appears in the work of Zecharia Sitchin (*The 12th Planet*, 1976), Jason Reza Jorjani, and various researchers who interpret Sumerian mythology as describing advanced technology in pre-modern language.
- **Criticism:** The ME are better understood as an abstract Sumerian concept for cosmic order (similar to Egyptian *Ma'at* or Hindu *Dharma*). Their physicalization in myth is a literary device, not a literal description of technology.

### 3.3 Pre-Catastrophe Global Civilization

- **Hypothesis:** A technologically advanced civilization existed before the Younger Dryas boundary event (~10,800 BCE). This civilization's emissaries or survivors traveled globally, spreading knowledge and leaving behind the handbag motif as a signature icon — "the mark of the knowledge-bringer."
- **Supporting observations:**
  - Göbekli Tepe (the oldest handbag motif) predates all other known examples by millennia
  - Knowledge-bringer figures appear worldwide (Apkallu, Viracocha, Quetzalcoatl, Oannes, Tāne — cf. C04)
  - All figures are associated with bringing civilization, agriculture, laws, and writing to humans
  - The "handbag" is consistently associated with these bringer-figures
- **Criticism:** No archaeological evidence for a global pre-Younger Dryas civilization has been found. The evidence is purely iconographic and mythological.

### 3.4 Biological Sample Containers

- **Fringe hypothesis:** The buckets contained **biological material** — seeds, DNA samples, or genetic material — being distributed or collected by advanced beings for purposes including:
  - Seeding/terraforming after a cataclysm
  - Genetic manipulation of humans or animals
  - Collecting specimens
- **Source:** Primarily internet-era speculation; not found in serious alternative research literature.

### 3.5 The Modern Briefcase Parallel

- **Observation:** The modern executive carrying a briefcase mirrors the ancient motif — a figure of authority/power holding a rectangular container of "knowledge" (documents, plans, codes). The nuclear "football" (Presidential Emergency Satchel) is a modern analogue: a handled container holding civilizational power.
- **Assessment:** An interesting cultural parallel but almost certainly coincidental. Bags are practical objects; the similarity does not require a causal connection across millennia.

---

## 4. DEBUNKED (Tier 4)

### 4.1 "All Handbag Motifs Look Identical"

- **Claim:** The handbag form is precisely the same across all cultures, proving a single origin.
- **Reality:** The objects vary significantly:
  - Assyrian banduddû: depicted as a metal or stone bucket with a rope or handle, often with visible bands or ridges
  - Göbekli Tepe: abstract carved outlines — rectangular body with a semicircular arch; no interior detail
  - Olmec: three-dimensional carved objects, sometimes with textured surfaces suggesting woven material
  - Maori kete: described as woven flax baskets, visually distinct from Mesopotamian buckets
- **Assessment:** The *general form* (container with handle) is similar, but the details differ substantially. Claims of identity are overstated by superficial comparison.

### 4.2 "There Is No Conventional Explanation"

- **Claim:** Mainstream archaeology cannot explain the banduddû or handbag motifs.
- **Reality:** Assyriologists have extensively documented the banduddû's role in Mesopotamian purification rituals. The object is not mysterious in its Assyrian context — it is a ritual aspersion bucket used alongside the mullilu (pine cone sprinkler) in apotropaic ceremonies. Ritual texts describe the practice.
- **What IS unexplained:** The appearance of similar forms at Göbekli Tepe (~9600 BCE) and La Venta (~900 BCE). These specific examples lack satisfying conventional explanations, but the claim that "there is no conventional explanation" for *any* of the motifs is false.

### 4.3 "The Pine Cone Is a Pineal Gland"

- **Claim:** The mullilu (pine cone) used alongside the banduddû represents the pineal gland ("third eye"), and the ritual depicts "activation" of human consciousness.
- **Reality:** The mullilu is identified in Akkadian texts as a date-palm spathe or pine cone used for sprinkling. The pineal gland interpretation is a modern overlay with no textual or contextual support from Mesopotamian sources.

## CULTURAL COMPARISON — Knowledge-Bringer + Container Pairings

The handbag motif becomes most significant when viewed alongside the **knowledge-bringer archetype** — semi-divine beings who arrive (often from the sea or the sky) to teach humanity the arts of civilization.

| Culture | Knowledge-Bringer | Container/Object | Knowledge Gifted |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Sumerian | Apkallu / Seven Sages | Banduddû (bucket) | Civilization, arts, ME |
| Sumerian | Inanna (via theft) | Boat carrying ME | 100+ divine powers |
| Babylonian | Oannes / Adapa | Emerges from sea | Writing, agriculture, law |
| Maori | Tāne | Three kete (baskets) | Sacred, ancestral, and worldly knowledge |
| Mesoamerican | Quetzalcoatl | Bag/pouch objects | Calendar, agriculture, arts |
| South American | Viracocha | Staff/carried items | Civilization after the flood |
| Egyptian | Thoth / Djehuti | Palette, stylus | Writing, mathematics, magic |
| Greek | Prometheus | Fennel stalk (container for fire) | Fire (technology/knowledge) |
| Hindu | Manu / Seven Rishis | Vessel on the cosmic ocean | Vedic knowledge after the flood |
| Aboriginal Australian | Wandjina | Carried objects (variable) | Law, creation knowledge |

**Pattern:** In nearly every case, the knowledge-bringer carries something — a container, a staff, a vessel. The knowledge is not abstract; it is **physically transported** and delivered. This consistent physicalization of knowledge across unrelated traditions is the core of the handbag mystery.

## TIMELINE — Handbag Motif Through History

```
~9600 BCE .... Göbekli Tepe, Pillar 43 — OLDEST KNOWN handbag motif
~3000 BCE .... Sumerian ME mythology — knowledge as portable physical objects
~2500 BCE .... Jiroft civilization, Iran — carved bucket-like chlorite vessels
~1800 BCE .... Old Babylonian tablets record Inanna-Enki myth (ME transport)
~1300 BCE .... Hittite Yazılıkaya — divine procession with handled objects
~900 BCE ..... Olmec La Venta — stone figures with bag-like objects
~883 BCE ..... Nimrud, Palace of Ashurnasirpal II — Apkallu with banduddû
~721 BCE ..... Khorsabad, Palace of Sargon II — more Apkallu with buckets
~800-300 BCE . European situla tradition — ritual/feasting buckets
~300 BCE ..... Sanchi Stupa, India — offering figures with containers
~900 CE ...... Tula, Toltec warriors with pouches
~1500 CE ..... Aztec/Mixtec codices — Quetzalcoatl with bags
undated ...... Māori kete tradition — three baskets of knowledge from heaven
```

**Key observation:** The Göbekli Tepe examples predate the next known occurrence by over **6,000 years**. This gap is enormous and suggests either:
1. Widespread use of the motif during the intervening millennia that left no surviving evidence (perishable materials, unexcavated sites)
2. Independent reinvention of the form
3. A surviving tradition transmitted orally/symbolically across the gap

---

## THE GÖBEKLI TEPE PROBLEM

Göbekli Tepe is the crux of the handbag mystery. Without it, the motif can be explained through:
- Mesopotamian ritual practice (banduddû) spreading via documented trade networks
- Convergent design for a simple practical form
- Coincidence in artistic convention

**But Göbekli Tepe changes the equation:**
- It is ~7,000 years older than the Assyrian examples
- It is in Anatolia, not Mesopotamia (though relatively nearby)
- The figures at Göbekli Tepe are carved in stone at a site of extraordinary sophistication — monumental architecture, coordinated labor, symbolic systems — all at a date when humans were supposedly pre-agricultural hunter-gatherers
- The three handbag shapes appear in a specific arrangement (a row above a complex scene), suggesting deliberate symbolic placement rather than decoration
- No Göbekli Tepe text exists to tell us what they mean — interpretation relies entirely on visual analysis and cross-cultural comparison

### Conventional Hypotheses for Pillar 43 Handbags:
1. **Architectural representations:** Stylized depictions of buildings, shelters, or structures (Schmidt 2006)
2. **Cosmograms:** Representations of cosmic regions — sky, earth, underworld (Engert; cf. three-realm cosmologies worldwide)
3. **Calendar/astronomical markers:** Sweatman & Tsikritsis (2017) argue they encode solstice or equinox positions
4. **Weight or measurement symbols:** Standardized units of some kind
5. **Unknown:** We simply do not know — and honest scholarship should say so

### Why "Just a Bag" Doesn't Fully Satisfy:
- If the shapes represent literal bags, what are they doing floating above a complex symbolic scene involving vultures, scorpions, and what may be decapitated human figures?
- Three identical objects in a row suggests a categorization system — a triptych — which parallels the Maori three kete and other tripartite knowledge divisions
- The objects are depicted at the top of the scene, in a position of prominence, suggesting they are more important than the figures below

## RESEARCH GAPS

### Unresolved Questions
1. **What specifically do the Göbekli Tepe handbag forms represent?** No textual record exists; interpretation remains speculative. Further excavation of unexcavated enclosures (only ~5% of the site has been excavated as of 2026) may reveal additional examples or context.
2. **Are there handbag motifs in the 6,000-year gap** between Göbekli Tepe (~9600 BCE) and the earliest Mesopotamian examples (~3000 BCE)? Sites such as Çatalhöyük, Karahan Tepe, and other Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites should be examined.
3. **Karahan Tepe parallels:** Recent excavations at Karahan Tepe (Şanlıurfa Province, Turkey), a site contemporary with Göbekli Tepe, have not yet yielded handbag motifs — but excavation is ongoing. Tas Tepeler project sites should be monitored.
4. **South American deep-time examples:** Are there handbag motifs in pre-Olmec South American cultures (Caral, Norte Chico, Valdivia)? Systematic survey needed.
5. **African examples:** Sub-Saharan African traditions have not been systematically surveyed for handbag/knowledge container parallels. The Dogon (Mali) and Zulu creation traditions may contain relevant material.
6. **Chinese and East Asian parallels:** Are there handbag-type objects in Shang Dynasty bronze imagery, Sanxingdui artifacts, or early Buddhist art that connect to this motif? The Sanxingdui bronze figures (Sichuan, China, ~1200 BCE) hold various objects — a systematic comparison has not been published.
7. **Physical artifacts:** Have any actual banduddû (as physical objects, not just depictions) been recovered archaeologically? Metal or stone buckets from Neo-Assyrian contexts exist but have not been definitively linked to the depicted objects.
8. **Compositional analysis:** If physical banduddû are found, what did they contain? Residue analysis could settle whether contents were water, oil, plant matter, or something else.
9. **3D morphometric comparison:** A rigorous, quantitative shape analysis comparing all known handbag motifs across cultures has not been conducted. Such a study could objectively determine whether the forms are truly similar or only superficially alike.
10. **Oral tradition depth:** The Māori kete tradition — how far back does it go? Is there any way to date the tradition's origin? Comparative Polynesian mythology (Hawaiian, Samoan, Tongan) may preserve earlier forms.

- **Survey Tas Tepeler sites** (Karahan Tepe, Harbetsuvan Tepe, Sayburç) for additional Pre-Pottery Neolithic handbag motifs
- **Compile exhaustive visual database** of all handbag/bucket motifs worldwide with standardized photography and measurement
- **Commission 3D scanning and morphometric comparison** of Göbekli Tepe, Assyrian, and Olmec examples
- **Search Sanxingdui and Jinsha site publications** for handled container parallels
- **Interview Māori tohunga (knowledge keepers)** about physical form traditions of the kete
