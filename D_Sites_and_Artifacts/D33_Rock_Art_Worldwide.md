## QUICK SUMMARY

Rock art — the oldest surviving form of human visual expression — spans every inhabited continent and extends from at least 45,500 years ago (Sulawesi, Indonesia, 2021 dating) to the historical present. This document surveys the global phenomenon across its three primary forms: **petroglyphs** (carved/pecked into rock surfaces — Valcamonica, Italy, with 300,000+ figures; Coso Range, California), **pictographs** (painted — Chauvet at 36,000 years, Lascaux, Altamira, Bhimbetka), and **geoglyphs** (landscape-scale ground markings — the 1,500+ Nazca Lines, Blythe Intaglios, Uffington White Horse). Key sites include Tassili n'Ajjer, Algeria (depicting a once-green Sahara with enigmatic "round-headed" figures), and Kakadu, Australia (preserving a continuous 20,000+ year artistic sequence). The Lewis-Williams neuropsychological model linking altered states of consciousness to rock art has become one of the most influential (and debated) theoretical frameworks in archaeology (→ K16). Dating methods range from radiocarbon (for organic binders) to uranium-series and optically stimulated luminescence.

### 1.2 Major Petroglyph (Carved) Sites [5/5 sources]

| Site | Location | Age | Key Features |
|------|----------|-----|-------------|
| **Valcamonica** | Lombardy, Italy | 8,000+ years (Mesolithic–Iron Age) | **300,000+ petroglyphs** — the largest collection in the world; UNESCO World Heritage (first rock art site inscribed, 1979); warriors, maps, geometric patterns, the famous "Camunian rose" |

### 1.3 Major Geoglyph Sites [5/5 sources]

| Site | Location | Age | Key Features |
|------|----------|-----|-------------|
| **Nazca Lines** | Peru | ~500 BCE–500 CE (Nazca culture) | **1,500+ geoglyphs** on the Nazca Pampa; 800 straight lines, 300 geometric figures, 70+ biomorphs (hummingbird, spider, monkey, condor, whale); created by removing dark surface pebbles to expose lighter ground beneath; largest figures: ~370m (pelican/alcatraz) |
| **Blythe Intaglios** | California, USA | ~900 CE – contact? | Giant human and animal figures (~30–50m) scraped into desert pavement; Mohave/Quechan tradition |
| **Uffington White Horse** | Oxfordshire, England | ~1000 BCE (Bronze Age; OSL dating) | 110m-long horse figure cut into chalk hillside; maintained for ~3,000 years by periodic re-cutting (community ritual) |
| **Atacama Giant** | Chile | ~1000–1400 CE | 119m-long anthropomorphic figure on hillside; largest prehistoric anthropomorphic geoglyph in the world |

### 1.4 Dating Methods [4/5 sources]
- **Radiocarbon (¹⁴C):** Applicable only to organic components — charcoal pigments, organic binders, overlying calcium carbonate layers with trapped organics. Range: up to ~50,000 years. Key limitation: many pigments are mineral (iron oxide, manganese) with no datable organic content.
- **Uranium-series (U-Th):** Dates calcium carbonate flowstone layers that form over paintings. Provides minimum age (if coating formed after painting). Used for the 2012 and 2018 dates of Spanish cave art (Alistair Pike et al.) and the 2019/2021 Sulawesi dates (Aubert et al.).
- **Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL):** Dates the last exposure to light of mineral grains (quartz, feldspar) in sediment or directly on rock surfaces. Applied to the Uffington White Horse and some petroglyph varnish layers.
- **Relative dating:** Superimposition (newer art overlies older); patina/varnish accumulation; stylistic seriation; associated artifact dating.

## 2. CREDIBLE CLAIMS (Tier 2 — Academic / Debated but Supported)

### 2.1 Lewis-Williams Neuropsychological Model [4/5 sources]
- **Core theory (Lewis-Williams & Dowson, 1988; Lewis-Williams, 2002):** Rock art — particularly geometric/abstract motifs (entoptic phenomena) — derives from visual experiences during altered states of consciousness (ASC):
  - **Stage 1:** Entoptic patterns (grids, dots, zigzags, spirals, nested catenary curves) — universal because they are generated by the nervous system itself, not cultural.
  - **Stage 2:** Construal — the brain attempts to make sense of entoptic forms by interpreting them as recognizable objects.
  - **Stage 3:** Iconic hallucinations — fully formed visions of animals, therianthropes, and scenes, experienced as hyper-real.
- **Evidence:** Remarkable similarity between entoptic patterns, San Bushmen rock art, and Upper Paleolithic art. San ethnographic accounts describe trance experiences closely matching the model.
- **Cross-cultural application:** Model has been applied to Coso Range, Saharan art, Australian art, and Mesoamerican art.
- **Criticism:** Not all rock art is produced in/about trance states; the model can be over-applied; some researchers (Bahn, 2010; Helvenston & Bahn, 2006) argue it is unfalsifiable and that "entoptic" patterns are too common in human visual experience to be specifically diagnostic of ASC.

### 2.2 Tassili n'Ajjer (Algeria) [4/5 sources]
- 15,000+ paintings and engravings across the Tassili plateau (central Sahara); UNESCO World Heritage Site.
- **"Round-headed" figures:** Large (up to 6m), corpulent humanoid figures with featureless round heads — period ~8000–6000 BCE. No consensus on what they represent. Proposed interpretations: masked ritual performers, ancestors, deities, or (in fringe literature) "aliens" (→ D08).
- **Pastoral scenes:** ~5000–2000 BCE; cattle, goats, giraffes, elephants, hippos — depicting a green, wet Sahara with rivers and lakes. Demonstrates dramatic Holocene climate change.
- **Hunting phase:** Earlier (~12,000–8000 BCE); wild animals, hunters with bows.
- The art provides a unique visual record of the Saharan environment before desertification.

### 2.3 Kakadu Rock Art Sequence (Australia) [4/5 sources]
- **20,000+ year continuous sequence** of rock art in Kakadu National Park, Northern Territory, Australia — one of the longest running art traditions on Earth.
- **Styles include:**
  - Dynamic figures (~12,000–8000 BP): Running, dancing, fighting human figures in elaborate headdresses.
  - X-ray art (later period): Animals depicted with internal organs, skeletal structure, and muscle systems visible — a sophisticated representational convention unique to Australian Aboriginal art.
  - Contact art (post-1788): Paintings of ships, rifles, and Europeans alongside traditional subjects.
- The sequence allows scientists to track environmental changes (sea level rise, species arrival/extinction) through art.
- Art is still being created by Aboriginal artists; it is a living tradition, not just an archaeological record.

### 2.4 Nazca Lines Function [3/5 sources]
- **Water cult hypothesis (David Johnson; Markus Reindel & Johny Isla):** Lines and trapezoids mark underground water sources (aquifers, fault lines); Nazca people depended on puquios (underground aqueduct system) in one of Earth's driest deserts.
- **Ritual walking paths (Anthony Aveni):** Lines were walked ceremonially — processional routes, not pictures meant to be seen from above. Pottery shards at line intersections support this.
- **Calendar/astronomical markers (Maria Reiche):** Some lines align with solstice or stellar rise positions — but Hawkins (1968) tested this and found no more alignments than chance would predict.
- **Alien landing strips (Erich von Däniken):** Thoroughly debunked — the lines are scratched into soft pebble desert pavement and would not support any vehicle; creation method is simple and documented (→ D08, §4).

## 3. SPECULATIVE CLAIMS (Tier 3 — Possible but Unverified)

### 3.1 Rock Art as Proto-Writing [2/5 sources]
- Genevieve von Petzinger (*The First Signs*, 2016) cataloged 32 recurring geometric signs across European Paleolithic cave art spanning 30,000 years — suggesting a shared symbolic code predating writing by tens of millennia.
- Whether these signs constitute a "code," a proto-writing system, or simply common human visual vocabulary remains unresolved (→ D20).

### 3.2 Therianthropes as Evidence of Shamanic Practice [3/5 sources]
- Therianthropic figures (part human, part animal: e.g., the Lascaux "bird-headed man," Chauvet "bison-man," Sulawesi therianthrope) are interpreted by Lewis-Williams's school as depictions of shamanic transformation during trance.
- Alternative interpretations: masked performers, mythological hybrid beings, or hunting disguises.
- The Sulawesi therianthrope (45,500 BP) — the oldest figurative composition in the world — is significantly older than European examples, suggesting therianthropic concepts are extremely ancient.

### 3.3 San Bushmen Rock Art as Ethnographic Key [2/5 sources]
- San rock art from southern Africa is uniquely interpretable because San informants (19th and 20th century) provided explanations of similar art to early ethnographers (Bleek & Lloyd, 1870s; Orpen, 1874).
- Lewis-Williams used San ethnography as a Rosetta Stone for Upper Paleolithic European art — controversial extrapolation across 20,000 km and 20,000 years.
- Supporters: structural similarities in imagery (therianthropes, entoptic forms, scenes of trance) transcend cultural specifics because they derive from universal neurology.
- Critics: Ethnographic analogy across such distances is methodologically problematic.

## 4. DUBIOUS CLAIMS (Tier 4 — No Credible Source)

### 4.1 Rock Art Depicts Alien Visitors [0/5 sources]
- Von Däniken (*Chariots of the Gods*, 1968) and successors interpret "round-headed" figures (Tassili), "astronaut" figures (Valcamonica), and other images as depictions of alien beings wearing helmets or spacesuits (→ D08).
- These interpretations ignore cultural context: masked ritual performers, mythological figures, and stylistic conventions explain the iconography without requiring extraterrestrial visitors.
- The Valcamonica "astronaut" is far more consistent with a warrior wearing a ceremonial headdress.

### 4.2 Nazca Lines as Alien Landing Strips [0/5 sources]
- Lines are scratched ~10–30 cm deep into desert pavement — they would not support the weight of any vehicle, terrestrial or otherwise.
- Simple creation method documented: removing dark oxidized pebbles to expose lighter clay beneath. Wooden stakes and cord for straight lines; no advanced technology needed.

### 4.3 All Rock Art Records Literal Events [0/5 sources]
- The assumption that all rock art is a literal "picture" of something seen (rather than symbolic, mythological, ritualistic, or generated from internal experience) is not supported by ethnographic evidence from living rock art traditions (Australian, San, Native American).
