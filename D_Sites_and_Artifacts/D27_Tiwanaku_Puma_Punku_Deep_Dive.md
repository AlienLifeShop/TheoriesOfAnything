## QUICK SUMMARY

Tiwanaku, situated at 3,825m elevation on the Bolivian Altiplano near the shores of Lake Titicaca, was the highest-altitude imperial capital in the ancient world. Flourishing from approximately 300 to 1000 CE, its influence spread across modern Bolivia, southern Peru, northern Chile, and northwest Argentina. The adjacent ceremonial complex of Puma Punku is renowned for its precision-cut H-blocks fashioned from andesite and red sandstone — stones so precisely shaped that they interlock without mortar, suggesting modular or prefabricated construction. The Gateway of the Sun, carved from a single block of andesite, features the "Staff God" figure (widely identified as Viracocha → C04) flanked by 48 winged attendants, possibly encoding a solar calendar. Tiwanaku's engineers also pioneered raised-field agriculture (suka kollus) capable of sustaining large populations at extreme altitude. Despite extensive study, key questions remain: how were blocks of 6–7 Mohs-hardness stone cut with such precision, and what caused the empire's collapse around 1000 CE?

## 1. VERIFIED CLAIMS (Tier 1 — Peer-Reviewed / Archaeological Record)

### 1.1 Tiwanaku as Imperial Capital [5/5 sources]
- Located ~72 km west of La Paz, Bolivia, at ~3,825m above sea level on the southern shore of Lake Titicaca.
- Population estimates: Core urban area housed 10,000–40,000; zone of influence: 400,000+ across the Tiwanaku sphere (~600,000 km²).
- Chronology: Proto-Tiwanaku/Early Tiwanaku (~300 BCE–300 CE); Classic Tiwanaku (~300–800 CE); Terminal Tiwanaku (~800–1000 CE). Collapse ~1000 CE.
- UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2000.

### 1.2 Major Architectural Complexes [5/5 sources]
- **Akapana:** Semi-natural hill reshaped into a step-pyramid ~18m high, ~200m per side; T-shaped drainage system running through its interior (sunken courts on top collected rainwater and channeled it through internal stone conduits — acoustically and hydrologically sophisticated).
- **Kalasasaya:** Large rectangular compound (~120 × 130m) bounded by tall standing stones; sunken courtyard within. Contains the Gateway of the Sun and the Ponce Monolith (~3m tall, elaborately carved).
- **Sunken Temple (Semi-subterranean Temple):** 28m × 26m sunken court with ~175 carved stone heads embedded in the walls — representing diverse ethnic features (multiple cultures or mythological beings?). Contains the Bennett Monolith (~7.3m tall — largest at the site).
- **Putuni (Palace of the Sarcophagi):** Elite residential/administrative complex with underground burial chambers.

### 1.3 Gateway of the Sun [5/5 sources]
- Carved from a single block of andesite (~3m tall, ~4m wide, ~10 tonnes).
- Central figure: Staff God / Viracocha — frontal figure with radiating head appendages (some ending in circles, others in puma heads), holding staffs in each hand. Weeping eyes (tear bands or "tear streaks").
- Flanked by three rows of 48 smaller "attendant" figures (winged beings in profile, some with bird heads, some with human heads) — 32 facing left, 16 facing right.
- Cracked in antiquity (pre-Columbian damage); found fallen, face-down when first described by European travelers in the 19th century.
- Calendar hypothesis: Posnansky (1945) and others interpreted the 48 figures as encoding a solar calendar (12 months × 4 weeks or related scheme) — debated but structurally suggestive.

### 1.4 Raised-Field Agriculture (Suka Kollus) [4/5 sources]
- System of elevated planting surfaces separated by water-filled channels, designed to:
  - Extend the growing season (water absorbs solar heat during the day, releasing it at night — protecting crops from frost at 4,000m).
  - Improve drainage and soil aeration.
  - Capture sediment and organic matter in channels (recycled as fertilizer).
- Experimental reconstructions (Kolata & Ortloff, 1989) demonstrated yields 2–7× higher than conventional dry farming at the same altitude.
- Supported the dense population of the Tiwanaku heartland where modern agriculture struggles.

## 2. CREDIBLE CLAIMS (Tier 2 — Academic / Debated but Supported)

### 2.1 Puma Punku Precision Stonework [4/5 sources]
- Located ~1 km southwest of the Tiwanaku core; heavily destroyed (possibly by earthquake, erosion, and post-Columbian stone-looting for colonial buildings and railroads).
- **H-blocks:** Distinctive interlocking blocks (resembling the letter H) with precise right angles, flat surfaces, and uniform recesses. Material: primarily red sandstone; some blocks of andesite (harder stone at 6–7 on Mohs scale).
- Largest block at Puma Punku: red sandstone slab estimated at ~131 tonnes.
- Quarry sites: Red sandstone from ~10 km away; andesite from quarries on the Copacabana Peninsula, ~90 km away across Lake Titicaca.
- **Interlocking system:** Blocks have I-shaped clamps (metal poured into channels to lock blocks together). Chemical analysis of clamp residues reveal a copper-arsenic-nickel alloy — evidence of sophisticated metallurgy.
- Surface flatness and angular precision are remarkable, though "machine-grade" claims are exaggerated by popular media. Jean-Pierre Protzen's experimental work (1993) demonstrated that many techniques are achievable with stone hammers, abrasive sand, and flat reference stones.

### 2.2 Calendar Encoding on the Gateway of the Sun [3/5 sources]
- Multiple scholars have proposed the Gateway iconography encodes astronomical cycles:
  - Posnansky: Solar calendar with corrections.
  - Bellamy & Allen (1956): "Tidal calendar" from a pre-existing moon (eccentric theory).
  - More recent analyses: Possible encoding of agricultural/ritual calendar synced to the Andean solar year.
- No consensus; the absence of a deciphered writing system makes verification impossible.

### 2.3 Lake-Shore Proximity in Antiquity [3/5 sources]
- Lake Titicaca's level has fluctuated significantly. During Tiwanaku's height, the lake may have been closer to the city than today (~15 km currently).
- Evidence: Raised agricultural fields, dock-like structures, and aquatic iconography suggest a lacustrine economy.
- Kolata (1993) argued for significant lacustrine recession contributing to Tiwanaku's collapse (~1000 CE), correlating with prolonged drought (ice-core evidence).

### 2.4 Copper-Alloy Clamps [3/5 sources]
- I-shaped and T-shaped metal clamps holding stone blocks together — rare in pre-Columbian Americas but paralleled in Old World traditions (Greece, India, Angkor Wat).
- Clamps were cast in situ: molten metal poured into channels carved between adjacent blocks.
- This technique implies portable smelting capability and standardized metallurgical procedures.

## 3. SPECULATIVE CLAIMS (Tier 3 — Possible but Unverified)

### 3.1 Pre-Flood Antiquity [2/5 sources]
- Arthur Posnansky (*Tiwanaku: Cradle of American Man*, 1945) dated the site to ~15,000 BCE based on astronomical alignment of the Kalasasaya walls — claiming they tracked obliquity of the ecliptic.
- Modern archaeology firmly dates the monumental phase to 300–1000 CE based on radiocarbon and ceramic seriation. Posnansky's methodology is rejected.

### 3.2 Advanced Unknown Technology [2/5 sources]
- Some researchers point to the extreme hardness of andesite and diorite (6–7 Mohs) and the precision of cuts as evidence of tools beyond what is archaeologically documented (copper, stone, and bone tools known from the site).
- Protzen (1993) demonstrated feasibility with documented tools, though acknowledged some surfaces were difficult to replicate experimentally.

### 3.3 Puma Punku as Prefabricated Construction [2/5 sources]
- The modular, repeating geometry of H-blocks suggests a prefabricated architectural system — blocks cut to standard dimensions, assembled like a kit.
- If confirmed, this would represent one of the earliest examples of standardized modular construction. However, the destroyed state of the site makes full reconstruction speculative.

## 4. DUBIOUS CLAIMS (Tier 4 — No Credible Source)

### 4.1 Extraterrestrial Construction [0/5 sources]
- Popular television programs have claimed Puma Punku was built by aliens due to its precision. No evidence supports non-human construction. Tool marks, quarry sites, construction ramps, and incomplete blocks (showing work-in-progress) all point to human craftsmanship.

### 4.2 15,000-Year-Old Date [0/5 sources]
- Posnansky's extreme dating is not supported by any modern chronometric method (radiocarbon, thermoluminescence, or archaeomagnetic dating). All reliable dates cluster between 300 and 1000 CE for the monumental architecture.

### 4.3 Laser-Cut Surfaces [0/5 sources]
- Claims of "laser-cut" or "machine-finished" stone surfaces rely on visual impression, not measurement. Protzen's petrographic analysis shows surfaces consistent with stone-on-stone abrasion.
