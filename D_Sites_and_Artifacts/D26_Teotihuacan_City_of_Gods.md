## QUICK SUMMARY

Teotihuacan — the name itself meaning "the place where gods were born" in Nahuatl, given by the Aztecs who found the city already in ruins — was one of the largest cities in the ancient world, reaching a peak population of 125,000–200,000 by ~100–550 CE. Located 50 km northeast of modern Mexico City, its builders remain **unknown**: no confirmed ethnic identity, no deciphered writing system, no named rulers. The city's monumental core includes the third-largest pyramid on Earth (Pyramid of the Sun), the Pyramid of the Moon, and the Temple of the Feathered Serpent — all organized along the precisely laid-out "Street of the Dead" at 15.5° east of north. Among the site's deepest mysteries are sheets of mica imported from ~4,800 km away (possibly Brazil) placed beneath floors with no decorative purpose, and liquid mercury found in chambers under the Temple of the Feathered Serpent (discovered 2014–2015). The city's influence was hemispheric, with evidence of multi-ethnic neighborhoods housing Oaxacan, Maya, and Gulf Coast populations.

## 1. VERIFIED CLAIMS (Tier 1 — Peer-Reviewed / Archaeological Record)

### 1.1 Urban Scale and Planning [5/5 sources]
- City area: ~20 km² of dense urban settlement; total zone of influence ~83 km².
- Population estimates: 125,000–200,000 at its zenith (~450 CE), making it the sixth-largest city in the world at the time.
- **Grid plan:** The entire city was laid out on a precise grid oriented 15.5° east of north, a deliberate deviation from cardinal directions. Streets, buildings, and even the San Juan River were canalized to conform to this grid.
- Over 2,000 apartment compounds housed the general population in multi-room, multi-family complexes — remarkably egalitarian by Mesoamerican standards.
- **Talud-tablero architecture:** Distinctive building style (sloping base surmounted by vertical rectangular panel) that became a hallmark; adopted across Mesoamerica.

### 1.2 Pyramid of the Sun [5/5 sources]
- **Dimensions:** Base ~225 × 222m; original height ~65m (fifth-largest pyramid in the world by volume).
- Built in one massive construction phase (~100 CE) over a pre-existing natural cave/tunnel.
- The cave beneath (discovered 1971 by Jorge Acosta) extends ~100m and ends in a clover-leaf-shaped set of chambers — interpreted as the original sacred feature around which the city was planned.
- Constructed from ~2.5 million tonnes of sun-dried adobe, rubble, and tepetate, faced with plastered stone.

### 1.3 Pyramid of the Moon [5/5 sources]
- **Dimensions:** Base ~150 × 130m; height ~43m (shorter than the Pyramid of the Sun but built on higher ground, so summits are at same elevation).
- Constructed in seven successive overlapping phases (~100–350 CE), each burying the previous version.
- Excavations (Saburo Sugiyama & Rubén Cabrera, 1998–2004) found multiple dedicatory burials: sacrificed humans (bound, some decapitated), animals (pumas, eagles, wolves, rattlesnakes), greenstone figurines, obsidian blades, and pyrite mirrors.

### 1.4 Temple of the Feathered Serpent (Ciudadela) [5/5 sources]
- Seven-tiered pyramid decorated with massive sculptured heads of the Feathered Serpent (Quetzalcoatl) and a second figure (War Serpent / Cipactli / Rain deity — identification debated).
- **Mass sacrifice:** Over 200 sacrificial victims found in dedicatory burials (Sugiyama, 1989–2004), hands bound behind backs, accompanied by greenstone earspools, obsidian projectile points, and shell ornaments. Individuals from multiple ethnic backgrounds (isotopic evidence).
- Tunnel system discovered beneath (Sergio Gómez, 2003–2015): 103m-long sealed tunnel leading to three chambers, undisturbed for 1,800+ years (see §2.3 — mercury deposits).

### 1.5 Multi-Ethnic Neighborhoods [4/5 sources]
- **Oaxaca Barrio (Tlailotlacan):** Zapotec-style ceramics, burial practices, and architecture; inhabitants maintained Zapotec ethnic identity for generations while living in Teotihuacan.
- **Merchants' Barrio:** Round adobe structures atypical of Teotihuacan style; Gulf Coast and Maya-related ceramics and figurines.
- Isotopic studies confirm many residents were first-generation immigrants from diverse Mesoamerican regions.

### 1.6 Mural Painting Tradition [4/5 sources]
- Nearly every apartment compound was decorated with polychrome murals — the most extensive mural program in pre-Columbian Americas.
- Subjects: deities (Great Goddess, Storm God, Feathered Serpent), jaguars, coyotes, flowering trees, streams with marine life, priests, warriors, and abstract symbols.
- Tepantitla compound murals depict a "paradise" scene with swimming figures, seeds, and a central deity figure.

## 2. CREDIBLE CLAIMS (Tier 2 — Academic / Debated but Supported)

### 2.1 Mica Deposits [3/5 sources]
- Mica sheets found in multiple locations, most notably beneath the floor of a building near the Pyramid of the Sun (the "Mica Temple").
- Two large mica sheets (~27m² combined) placed between construction layers — not decorative, not visible from any surface.
- Chemical analysis: mica identified as muscovite, sourced from a region ~4,800 km away (possibly Minas Gerais, Brazil — this distance is debated; some suggest closer Mexican sources).
- **Purpose unknown:** Mica is thermally and electrically insulating. Speculative hypotheses range from ceremonial to functional (radiation shielding, insulation). No consensus.

### 2.2 The 15.5° Alignment [4/5 sources]
- The city's consistent 15.5° east-of-north orientation has been linked to:
  - Sunset position on August 12/13 (one of two annual dates when the sun passes directly overhead at this latitude — related to the beginning of the Mesoamerican calendar cycle).
  - Alignment toward Cerro Gordo (sacred mountain to the north).
  - Mathematical/cosmological significance (pecked cross-circle petroglyphs found at key points may encode the grid's geometry).
- Šprajc (2000) and Malmström (1978) support astronomical interpretation; others attribute it primarily to landscape/hydrological factors.

### 2.3 Mercury Under the Temple of the Feathered Serpent [3/5 sources]
- In 2014–2015, archaeologist Sergio Gómez reported discovering large quantities of liquid mercury in the sealed chambers beneath the Temple of the Feathered Serpent.
- Mercury has been found at other Mesoamerican sites (e.g., Copán, El Paraíso) — possibly representing underworld rivers or sacred water.
- Mercury was produced by heating cinnabar (HgS), which was widely used for red pigment and ritual in Mesoamerica. The production of liquid mercury indicates advanced chemical processing knowledge.

### 2.4 Builders' Identity [4/5 sources]
- **No confirmed ethnicity:** The city has no deciphered writing system (only numerical notations and a few glyphic signs), no historical records from the city's own inhabitants.
- Candidates proposed: Proto-Nahua, Totonac, Otomí, or a multi-ethnic polity with no single dominant group.
- The Aztecs attributed the city's construction to gods or giants (Quinametzin) — they did not claim to have built it themselves.

## 3. SPECULATIVE CLAIMS (Tier 3 — Possible but Unverified)

### 3.1 Mica as Technological Material [2/5 sources]
- Hypothesis that mica was used for its piezoelectric, thermal, or electrical properties in some unknown technological application (→ M01, D21).
- No evidence of electrical or mechanical devices at Teotihuacan contradicts technologically sophisticated interpretations.

### 3.2 Street of the Dead as Model of Solar System [1/5 sources]
- Hugh Harleston Jr. (1974) claimed the pyramids and temples along the Street of the Dead encode planetary distances in a scaled model of the solar system (using a unit he called the "hunab" = 1.0594m).
- Not accepted by mainstream archaeoastronomy; considered numerological (selective measurement fitting).

### 3.3 Pyramid of the Sun as Energy Device [1/5 sources]
- Fringe hypothesis that the cave beneath the pyramid, combined with mica and specific geometry, created an energy-generating device.
- No physical mechanism proposed; no supporting evidence.

---

## 4. DUBIOUS CLAIMS (Tier 4 — No Credible Source)

### 4.1 Constructed by Atlanteans or Extraterrestrials [0/5 sources]
- No credible evidence. The phased construction over centuries, use of local materials, and cultural continuity with broader Mesoamerican traditions all indicate indigenous human development.

### 4.2 Nuclear Explosion / Vitrified Ruins [0/5 sources]
- Occasional claims of "fused" or "vitrified" stones at Teotihuacan conflate lime plaster (calcium carbonate) surface treatments with high-temperature events. No evidence of anomalous heating.
