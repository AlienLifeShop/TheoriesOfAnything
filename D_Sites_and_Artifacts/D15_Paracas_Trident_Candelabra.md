## QUICK SUMMARY

The Paracas Candelabra (also called "Candelabro de Paracas" or "the Trident") is a massive geoglyph carved into the sandy hillside of the Paracas Peninsula on Peru's southern coast, overlooking Pisco Bay. Measuring ~180 m (595 ft) tall and ~60 m wide, it is visible from up to 20 km out at sea and has been carbon-dated by surrounding pottery to ~200 BCE (Paracas culture period), though some researchers argue for greater antiquity. Its precise function and meaning remain UNKNOWN — no colonial Spanish or Inca account definitively explains it, and the Paracas culture left no writing. The standard interpretive candidates are: (a) a representation of the jimsonweed (*Brugmansia*) or San Pedro cactus (*Echinopsis pachanoi*) — both psychoactive plants used in Paracas shamanic practice, (b) a navigational marker for incoming maritime traffic, (c) a symbol of a deity — possibly related to the trident/staff-bearer figures found on Paracas textiles, or (d) a ceremonial cosmological marker linking sky, earth, and sea. The trident form is cross-culturally significant: Poseidon/Neptune (Greek/Roman), Shiva's trishula (Hindu), the Buddhist triratna, the Mesopotamian lightning fork, and various Polynesian symbols share the three-pronged motif. The Paracas culture is also the source of the famous elongated skulls (see D07) — some of which show anomalous features that have fueled extensive debate. The Candelabra, the Nazca Lines (~80 km to the southeast), and the Paracas textiles collectively represent one of the most sophisticated symbolic systems of the ancient Americas — and one of the least understood.

## 1. VERIFIED CLAIMS (Tier 1 — Archaeological and Physical Evidence)

### 1.1 Physical Description of the Candelabra [5/5 sources]
- **Location:** 13.7637° S, 76.2973° W — the northern face of the Paracas Peninsula, Pisco Province, Ica Region, Peru
- **Dimensions:** approximately 180 m (595 ft) from top to base, approximately 60 m (200 ft) wide at its broadest span
- **Construction:** carved into a sandy hillside with a hardened caite (calcium sulfate/gypsum) surface crust. The design is cut ~60 cm (2 ft) deep into the hillside.
- **Preservation:** the region receives almost NO rainfall (~2 mm/year), and the hardened surface crust resists wind erosion. Additionally, the prevailing onshore winds actually FILL the trenches with sand from the beach, maintaining the figure's visibility by contrast.
- **Visibility:** visible from up to ~20 km (12 miles) out to sea. Sailors have reported seeing it from even farther in clear conditions.
- **Form:** three main prongs emanating from a central base/trunk, with secondary branching on each prong. The overall shape has been compared to a candelabrum (hence the Spanish name), a trident, or a cactus.

### 1.2 The Paracas Culture Context [4/5 sources]
- **Paracas culture (~800-100 BCE):** pre-Columbian civilization on Peru's southern coast
  - Two phases: Paracas Cavernas (earlier) and Paracas Necropolis (later)
  - Famous for: textiles (the finest pre-Columbian weaving known, with 200+ color variations), trephination (skull surgery), and elongated skulls
  - The Necropolis of Wari Kayan: 429 mummy bundles, each wrapped in extraordinary textiles depicting geometric and mythological figures — including staff-bearing deities, serpents, and figures with three-pronged head ornaments
- **Dating of the Candelabra:**
  - The geoglyph itself cannot be directly dated
  - Pottery fragments found at the site are Paracas-era (~200 BCE)
  - Some researchers suggest it may be older based on erosion patterns, but this is speculative
  - It may also have been maintained or modified by later cultures (Nazca, Chincha, Inca)
- **Relationship to Nazca Lines:** the Candelabra predates the Nazca Lines (~500 BCE-500 CE) but is stylistically different. The Nazca Lines are on a flat desert pampa; the Candelabra is on a steep hillside facing the ocean. They may represent different traditions within a broader geoglyph culture.

### 1.3 The Paracas Elongated Skulls Connection [3/5 sources]
- **The same culture that created the Candelabra also practiced cranial modification:**
  - Over 300 elongated skulls found in the Paracas region (see D07)
  - Julio Tello (1925, 1929) excavated the major Paracas sites
  - Most Paracas skulls show evidence of artificial cranial deformation (head boarding/binding in infancy)
  - A SUBSET of skulls show anomalous features: single parietal plate (vs. normal two), different foramen magnum position, and ~25% greater cranial volume. These anomalies are debated.
  - **Brien Foerster and Juan Navarro:** collected samples for DNA analysis. Initial results (2014, incomplete) reported mitochondrial haplogroups with origins in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and possibly unknown populations. Full peer-reviewed genomic analysis is still pending.
- **The combination of elongated skulls + Candelabra + sophisticated textiles + skull surgery indicates a culture with MUCH more complexity than typically attributed to "pre-literate coastal peoples"**

## 2. CREDIBLE CLAIMS (Tier 2 — Interpretive but Well-Supported)

### 2.1 Interpretations of the Candelabra [3/5 sources]
- **Psychoactive plant representation:**
  - The three-pronged shape closely resembles *Brugmansia suaveolens* (angel's trumpet / jimsonweed) or the three-ribbed profile of the San Pedro cactus (*Echinopsis pachanoi*)
  - BOTH plants were central to Paracas shamanic practice — San Pedro use is documented to ~2000 BCE at Chavín de Huántar (same cultural sphere)
  - The branching pattern on the prongs matches botanical morphology
  - **If correct:** the Candelabra is a monumental advertisement of shamanic power — a 180-meter-tall psychoactive plant, visible from the sea, announcing "this is a place of power/knowledge"
- **Navigational marker:**
  - The Candelabra faces directly out to sea and is perfectly positioned to be visible to approaching vessels
  - Pisco Bay was one of the most important harbors on the Peruvian coast
  - The Chincha culture (which succeeded the Paracas) were known maritime traders with balsa rafts
  - **If correct:** the Candelabra is the ancient Peruvian equivalent of a lighthouse or harbor marker
- **Deity/cosmological symbol:**
  - Staff-god/trident-bearer figures appear on Paracas and Nazca textiles and pottery
  - The "Staff God" (later formalized as Viracocha at Tiwanaku) holds staffs in both hands and sometimes wears a three-pronged headdress
  - The Candelabra's trident form may represent this deity or the axis mundi (cosmic tree/axis connecting underworld, earth, and sky — the three prongs being three cosmic levels)
  - **If correct:** the Candelabra is a sacred cosmological monument

### 2.2 The Cross-Cultural Trident Pattern [3/5 sources]
- **The trident/three-pronged symbol appears in nearly every major ancient tradition:**

| Culture | Symbol | Deity/Context | Function |
|---------|--------|---------------|----------|
| Greek | Trident | Poseidon | Lord of the sea, earthquakes, horses |
| Roman | Trident | Neptune | Same as Poseidon |
| Hindu | Trishula | Shiva | Destruction/transformation of the three gunas |
| Buddhist | Triratna / Trishula | Three Jewels | Buddha, Dharma, Sangha |
| Mesopotamian | Lightning fork | Adad / Hadad | Storm god's weapon |
| Norse | Trident-like rune | Various | Associated with water, Ægir |
| Polynesian | Triple fish-hook | Maui / Tangaroa | Sea domination |
| Etruscan | Trident | Nethuns | Sea god |
| Andean | Staff/trident | Staff God / Viracocha | Creator/knowledge giver |

- **Common associations of the trident:**
  - **Water/sea:** Poseidon, Neptune, Nethuns, Tangaroa — the trident is overwhelmingly associated with maritime/aquatic power
  - **Cosmic axis / triple world:** the three prongs = three cosmic levels (earth, sky, underworld) — or three stages of time (past, present, future)
  - **Shiva's trishula specifically:** the three prongs represent icchā (will), jñāna (knowledge), and kriyā (action) — OR the three gunas (qualities: sattva, rajas, tamas)
  - **Transformation/power:** the trident is almost always a weapon or tool of POWER, wielded by a sovereign deity

### 2.3 The Paracas-to-Nazca Continuity [3/5 sources]
- **The Paracas culture evolved into the Nazca culture (~100 BCE-800 CE):**
  - Geographic overlap in the Ica/Nazca river valleys
  - Artistic continuity — Nazca pottery and textile motifs develop from Paracas styles
  - Both cultures created geoglyphs (the Candelabra predates the Nazca Lines)
  - Both had sophisticated textile traditions
  - Both practiced cranial modification
- **The Nazca Lines (UNESCO World Heritage Site):**
  - Over 1,000 geoglyphs on the Nazca Pampa — animals, plants, geometric shapes, lines
  - Purpose: debated. Maria Reiche's astronomical calendar hypothesis, Anthony Aveni's water/ritual hypothesis, David Johnson's underground water mapping hypothesis
  - The lines are best seen from the air — but they are made BY walking (creating paths that remove dark pebbles to reveal lighter ground beneath). They are processional pathways, not art meant for viewing from altitude.
- **If the Candelabra was the FIRST geoglyph in this tradition, it suggests a coastal > inland progression** — beginning with a sea-facing symbol and expanding to the massive inland Nazca complex

## 3. SPECULATIVE CLAIMS (Tier 3 — Possible but Unverified)

### 3.1 Maritime Contact Network Marker [2/5 sources]
- **Hypothesis:** the Candelabra was part of a Pacific maritime contact network
  - Thor Heyerdahl (Kon-Tiki 1947, Ra I/II 1969-70) demonstrated the FEASIBILITY of trans-oceanic voyaging with ancient technology
  - The Chincha (successors to Paracas) had extensive maritime trade using large balsa rafts — south to Chile, north to Ecuador and beyond
  - If Pacific maritime contacts were more extensive than currently accepted, the Candelabra could serve as a landmark/welcome sign for a broader seafaring culture
  - **Connection to Polynesian traditions:** Polynesian oral histories describe voyages eastward to a "land of the long cloud" or large landmass. The trident/fish-hook parallel between Polynesian and Andean traditions could support maritime contact.
- **Counter:** no definitive archaeological evidence of trans-Pacific contact has been confirmed at Paracas specifically (though sweet potato transfer between South America and Polynesia ~1000 CE is well-established)

### 3.2 The Three-Pronged Symbol as Universal Consciousness Pattern [2/5 sources]
- **Jeremy Narby and others have noted:** the trident/three-pronged motif appears in shamanic traditions worldwide, often associated with:
  - The cosmic tree / axis mundi
  - Altered states of consciousness
  - The junction point between worlds
- **If visionary/trance states produce similar geometric patterns universally (as suggested by Lewis-Williams & Dowson 1988, "entoptic phenomena"),** then the trident form could be a neurologically generated pattern that every culture independently incorporates into its cosmology
- **This would explain** why the Paracas Candelabra, Shiva's trishula, and Poseidon's trident share the same form WITHOUT requiring direct cultural contact

---

## 4. DUBIOUS CLAIMS (Tier 4 — Scientifically Unsupported)

### 4.1 "The Candelabra Points to the Nazca Lines" [2/5 sources]
- **[GEOMETRICALLY FALSE]** Often repeated in popular sources. The Candelabra faces northwest (out to sea). The Nazca Lines are southeast of the peninsula. While both are in the same cultural region, the Candelabra does not serve as a directional pointer to the Nazca Pampa.

### 4.2 "Aliens Created the Candelabra as a Landing Marker" [2/5 sources]
- **[UNSUBSTANTIATED]** No evidence supports extraterrestrial construction. The geoglyph is within the documented capabilities of Paracas culture and requires no technology beyond human labor and sand removal.
