## Overview

Göbekli Tepe is an archaeological site in southeastern Turkey that has fundamentally challenged the accepted timeline of human civilization. Dated to approximately 9600–8000 BCE, it predates Stonehenge by ~6,000 years and the Great Pyramid of Giza by ~7,000 years. It was built BEFORE the supposed invention of agriculture, writing, pottery, and settled civilization. The site's scale, skilled stonework, and deliberate burial indicate sophisticated social coordination among non-sedentary groups, rewriting the developmental model for complex human societies.

**Source Agreement:** All 5 research sources (Claude, Gemini, GPT5.2, Raptor, Master) independently identified this site as a paradigm-shifting discovery. Core claims represent **[5/5 SOURCES]** unless otherwise noted.

## 2. Chronology and Radiocarbon Dating

**Reliability: TIER 1 — VERIFIED** | **[5/5 SOURCES]**

### Radiocarbon Dates

| Phase | Layer | Date Range | Structure Type |
|-------|-------|------------|----------------|
| **PPNA** (Pre-Pottery Neolithic A) | Layer III | ~9600–8500 BCE | Large circular enclosures with monumental T-pillars |
| **PPNB** (Pre-Pottery Neolithic B) | Layer II | ~8500–8200 BCE | Smaller, rectangular rooms with smaller pillars |

- Primary phases dated to **9600–8200 BCE** — radiocarbon confirmed
- Older circular enclosures (Layer III) are the most architecturally impressive
- Younger rectangular structures (Layer II) overlie the filled earlier enclosures
- The complex predates pottery, large-scale farming, and urbanism

### Why the Dates Matter

- 6,000 years older than Stonehenge
- 7,000 years older than the Great Pyramid of Giza
- Challenges the assumption that agriculture led to monumental building
- Some archaeologists argue ritual gathering drove the development of agriculture

---

## 3. Physical Structure

### The T-Shaped Pillars

**Reliability: TIER 1 — VERIFIED** | **[5/5 SOURCES]**

- Massive T-shaped limestone pillars arranged in circles (enclosures)
- Height: **3–6 meters (10–20 feet)**
- Weight: individual pillars weigh **up to 10–20 metric tons**
- The largest unfinished pillar (still in the quarry): approximately **7 meters tall, ~50 tons**
- Quarry approximately 100 meters from the main site
- Pillars were carved from the surrounding limestone plateau
- Two larger central pillars in each enclosure (up to ~5.5 meters)
- Carvings: high-relief sculptures of animals (lions, bulls, boars, foxes, gazelles, snakes, scorpions, spiders)
- **Anthropomorphic interpretation [5/5 SOURCES]:** The "T" shape represents a stylized human profile:
  - Horizontal top = head/shoulders
  - Vertical shaft = body
  - Some pillars have carved arms, hands, belts, and loincloths on the vertical shaft
  - Some have fingers meeting at the front (at the "belly"/navel area)

### Construction Technique

- Stone tools only — no metal tools existed at this period
- Flint tools and possibly wooden/bone implements were used
- Pillars were carved in situ at the quarry, then transported ~100 meters
- Quarrying and transport of 10–20 ton blocks required coordinated labor
- Estimates suggest **hundreds of workers** were needed to carve, move, and erect each pillar
- **Floors include terrazzo-like lime surfaces** — evidence of sophisticated finishing techniques **[GPT5.2, Master]**
- **Grinding stones and cereal residues** present at the site, though no clear domesticated crops identified **[GPT5.2]**

### The Enclosures — Enclosure-by-Enclosure Breakdown

**Reliability: TIER 1 — VERIFIED** | **[5/5 SOURCES]**

At least **20 circular enclosures** identified through geophysical surveys (ground-penetrating radar); only a handful excavated:

| Enclosure | Period | Key Features |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| **Enclosure A** (Pillar of the Snake) | PPNA (~9600–8500 BCE) | Named for prominent snake relief; serpent imagery dominates |
| **Enclosure B** (Pillar of the Fox) | PPNA | Fox imagery prominent; both 2D reliefs and 3D-like carving |
| **Enclosure C** (Circle of the Boar) | PPNA | Largest excavated enclosure; most elaborate carvings; boar reliefs dominate |
| **Enclosure D** (Pillar of the Vulture) | PPNA | Contains the famous "Vulture Stone" (Pillar 43); vulture, scorpion, and "handbag" motifs; headless human figure |
| **Layer II structures** | PPNB (~8500–8200 BCE) | Smaller, rectangular rooms with smaller pillars; represent a later phase of construction |
| **~15+ unexcavated** | Unknown | Only identified via ground-penetrating radar — 90–95% of site remains buried |

**Enclosure layout pattern:** Each enclosure features a central pair of larger pillars surrounded by smaller pillars embedded in a curving stone wall. The central pillars face each other. The enclosures vary in diameter but follow a consistent architectural template.

**GPR survey potential:** Large-scale ground-penetrating radar surveys have identified the 20+ enclosures but significant potential remains for extended GPR mapping across the ridge to locate additional structures and features **[Raptor]**.

## 4. The Carvings and Imagery

**Reliability: TIER 1 — VERIFIED** | **[5/5 SOURCES]**

### Animal Relief Frequency Table

Over **60 species** of animals are depicted in high-relief carvings across the site:

| Animal | Frequency | Notable Features |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Serpents/Snakes** | Very common | Among the most prominent carvings across ALL enclosures; appear on oldest pillars |
| **Foxes** | Very common | Both 2D reliefs and 3D sculpture; possibly symbolic of clan identity |
| **Boars/Wild pigs** | Common | Large, detailed reliefs; also seen at other Anatolian sites |
| **Vultures** | Common | Associated with death/sky burial rituals; prominent in Enclosure D |
| **Aurochs (wild bulls)** | Common | Large, prominent; dangerous prey species |
| **Cranes/Birds** | Common | Various bird species depicted |
| **Scorpions** | Present | Significant on Pillar 43; appear in multiple panels |
| **Spiders** | Present | Multiple examples; rare but consistent |
| **Lions/Leopards** | Present | Predator imagery; possible guardian symbolism |
| **Gazelles** | Present | Prey species; regional wildlife |
| **Insects** | Present | Various species |
| **Ducks/Waterfowl** | Present | Aquatic fauna represented |

### Key Observations About the Imagery

- **No domesticated animals are depicted** — all are wild species **[5/5 SOURCES]**
- **No clear depictions of hunting scenes** — the animals appear as symbols, not prey **[4/5 SOURCES]**
- **Serpents are among the most prominent and earliest carvings** — they appear in virtually every enclosure **[5/5 SOURCES]**
- **No female figures** in the earliest layers — human representation is abstract (T-pillars) **[Claude]**
- Some pillars show animals in apparent motion or interaction
- The carvings show remarkable artistic sophistication for the period
- The lack of domesticated animals suggests a hunter-gatherer worldview **[5/5 SOURCES]**
- Mainstream interpretation: totemic or mythic symbolism linked to clan groups
- Alternative: a coherent symbolic language with cosmic or astronomical meaning

### Serpent Imagery Specifically

- Serpents/snakes appear on pillars across the site in multiple enclosures
- Enclosure A is specifically named "Pillar of the Snake" due to prominent snake carvings
- Snakes are shown in various poses — coiling, ascending pillars, interacting with other animals
- Some pillars show networks or groups of snakes
- Snakes appear on some of the OLDEST pillars at the site
- This makes Göbekli Tepe one of the earliest known sites with prominent serpent symbolism in monumental architecture

## 5. The "Vulture Stone" — Pillar 43

**Reliability: TIER 1 (existence) / TIER 2–3 (astronomical interpretation)** | **[5/5 SOURCES]**

### Description

- Located in **Enclosure D**
- A major relief panel — one of the most analyzed carvings at the site
- Depicts a vulture or bird with a sphere (circle/disc) above or in its wing
- A headless human figure appears below
- A scorpion is depicted prominently
- Other animals appear in apparent arrangement

### Competing Interpretations

| Interpretation | Proponent | Status |
|---------------|-----------|--------|
| **Standard Neolithic symbolic art** | Mainstream archaeologists | Default interpretation — narrative scene linked to death or sky burial traditions |
| **Astronomical date marker** (~10,950 BCE) | Sweatman & Tsikritsis (2017) | Peer-reviewed (*Mediterranean Archaeology and Archaeometry* Vol. 17, No. 1) but disputed by other archaeoastronomers |
| **Record of Younger Dryas impact** | Connected to Sweatman's work | Speculative extrapolation from the astronomical theory |

- The astronomical interpretation argues the carvings represent constellations (Sagittarius, Scorpio, etc.) and could record a specific astronomical event — possibly linked to the Younger Dryas comet impact (~10,800 BCE)
- Published in a peer-reviewed journal but not widely accepted in mainstream archaeology
- Some scholars see standard Neolithic symbolic art consistent with other regional sites

### The "Handbag" Motif — Cross-Cultural Comparison

**Reliability: TIER 2 — CREDIBLE** | **[Gemini, Master]**

The top of Pillar 43 features three "handbag" or "purse" shapes. This motif appears across four geographically separated cultures:

| Culture | Context | Details |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Göbekli Tepe** (Turkey, ~9500 BCE) | Pillar 43, Enclosure D | Three "handbag" shapes carved along the top register |
| **Sumerian / Mesopotamian** (~3000–2000 BCE) | Held by Apkallu/Anunnaki in palace reliefs | Known as *banduddû*; carried by fish-cloaked sages (see → A07) |
| **Olmec** (Mexico, ~1500–400 BCE) | Held by carved figures at La Venta and other sites | Identical form; figures associated with knowledge transmission |
| **Māori** (New Zealand) | Traditional carved figures | Similar "bucket" or container shape in ancestral art |

**Interpretation debated:** Carriers of civilization, seeds, knowledge, or sacred substances? The cross-cultural recurrence of an identical motif across millennia and continents remains unexplained by mainstream diffusionist models (see → C08).

## 6. The Timeline Revolution — Why Göbekli Tepe Matters

**Reliability: TIER 1 — VERIFIED** | **[5/5 SOURCES]**

### The Standard Archaeological Model (Before Göbekli Tepe)

The accepted sequence of human development was:
1. Agriculture (~8000 BCE) → 2. Permanent settlements → 3. Social hierarchy → 4. Religion → 5. Monumental architecture

### What Göbekli Tepe Demonstrates

Göbekli Tepe **inverts** this sequence:
1. **Monumental architecture & organized religion** (~9600 BCE) CAME FIRST
2. **Agriculture** appears to have developed AFTER (~8500–8000 BCE)
3. Nearby sites (Karahan Tepe, Nevalı Çori) show similar patterns

This means:
- Complex religion existed BEFORE farming
- Large-scale organized labor existed BEFORE permanent settlements
- Sophisticated stone carving existed BEFORE pottery
- Social organization capable of feeding hundreds of workers existed BEFORE agriculture

Klaus Schmidt's famous summary: **"First came the temple, then the city."** **[5/5 SOURCES]**

### The Labor Question

- Carving, transporting, and erecting 10–20 ton pillars required organized teams
- Workers needed to be fed — but no agriculture existed yet
- This implies either:
  - Hunter-gatherers were far more organized and capable than previously believed
  - Or some other food production/storage system existed that has not been identified
- **Function hypotheses [Raptor]:** Ritual center, seasonal pilgrimage site, or proto-temple supporting social aggregation and the later development of agriculture

Göbekli Tepe proves that "primitive" hunter-gatherers possessed **[Gemini]**:
1. Complex social hierarchy and organization (to mobilize labor)
2. Advanced geometric planning and masonry
3. Symbolic language (reliefs)

---

## 7. The Einkorn Domestication Link

**Reliability: TIER 1 — VERIFIED** | **[5/5 SOURCES]**

- Wild **einkorn wheat** (*Triticum monococcum*) grows naturally in the area surrounding Göbekli Tepe
- Genetic studies place the domestication of einkorn at **Karaca Dağ (Karacadağ)**, just ~20–30 km from Göbekli Tepe **[5/5 SOURCES]**
- This is the oldest known domesticated einkorn — ancestor of modern wheat **[Gemini]**
- **Grinding stones** and cereal residues are present at the site, but no clearly domesticated crops have been identified in the earliest layers **[GPT5.2]**
- Some scholars propose that **Göbekli Tepe's labor demands may have DRIVEN the invention of agriculture** — the need to feed construction workers and ritual participants led to cultivating wild grains **[4/5 SOURCES]**
- **Raptor framing:** Regional ties to early cereal domestication suggest a transformational linkage between ritual labor and plant cultivation — monumental building may have drawn large seasonal gatherings that incentivized early cultivation and domestication

### Traditional vs. Göbekli Tepe Model

| Traditional Model | Göbekli Tepe Model |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Farming leads to food surplus | Monumental ritual sites draw large gatherings |
| Surplus enables monument building | Gatherings incentivize early cultivation and domestication |
| Settlement → religion | Religion → settlement → agriculture |

---

## 8. The Deliberate Burial — Stratigraphic Framing

**Reliability: TIER 1 (the event) / TIER 3 (the reason)** | **[5/5 SOURCES]**

### What Happened

- Around **8000 BCE**, Göbekli Tepe was **deliberately and carefully buried**
- The enclosures were filled with rubble, stone chips, animal bones, stone tools, and soil — totaling thousands of tons of fill material
- This was NOT natural sedimentation — it was intentional backfilling **[5/5 SOURCES]**
- The burial preserved the site remarkably well for ~10,000 years
- Different enclosures were buried at different times
- The care taken in filling suggests respect rather than destruction
- The site was not destroyed — it was preserved
- **Stratigraphic interpretation [Raptor]:** The deliberate infilling preserved the site and is read through the stratigraphic record as ritual termination, social reorganization, or strategic concealment — each interpretation carrying different implications for understanding the Neolithic transition

### Proposed Explanations

| Theory | Argument | Support Level | Sources Citing |
|--------|----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Ritual closure / decommissioning** | Sacred sites deliberately retired when their "purpose was served" or when a community moved to new practices | Mainstream — strongest support | **[5/5 SOURCES]** |
| **Foundation for new construction** | Older enclosures filled to create platforms for newer, smaller structures (Layer II) | Mainstream — supported by stratigraphy | **[3/5 SOURCES]** |
| **Cultural transition** | The shift from hunter-gatherer to agricultural society made the old temple obsolete | Mainstream — fits broader Neolithic transition | **[4/5 SOURCES]** |
| **Ideological shift** | The "old gods" were rejected in favor of new belief systems | Speculative but plausible | **[Gemini]** |
| **Knowledge suppression / protection** | Someone deliberately buried the site to hide or protect its knowledge | Alternative — no direct evidence | **[2/5 SOURCES]** |
| **Catastrophe response** | A major event (flood, climate shift) prompted the burial as protection or abandonment | Alternative — timing near Younger Dryas end | **[1/5 SOURCES]** |

### What Is Clear

- The burial was deliberate and required enormous organized labor — comparable to building the site itself
- The 90–95% unexcavated portion could contain significant surprises
- **No single explanation has achieved consensus** **[GPT5.2]**

---

## 9. Connection to Younger Dryas Impact Theory

**Reliability: TIER 2 — CREDIBLE (event) / TIER 3 (connection to Göbekli Tepe)** | **[4/5 SOURCES]**

### The Younger Dryas (~12,800–11,600 years ago / ~10,800–9600 BCE)

- A sudden return to near-glacial conditions lasting ~1,200 years
- Occurred during a period of general warming after the last Ice Age
- Cause debated:
  - **Impact hypothesis:** A comet or asteroid fragment struck the Laurentide Ice Sheet (North America), causing massive flooding, cooling, and megafaunal extinctions
  - **Meltwater pulse:** Disruption of ocean circulation (mainstream position)
  - **Volcanic activity:** Multiple volcanic events

### Connection to Göbekli Tepe

- Göbekli Tepe's construction begins near the END of the Younger Dryas (~9600 BCE)
- Sweatman & Tsikritsis (2017) argue Pillar 43 records the Younger Dryas comet event (~10,950 BCE)
- Graham Hancock and others propose that the Younger Dryas destroyed an advanced pre-Ice Age civilization, and sites like Göbekli Tepe represent the survivors' attempt to preserve knowledge
- **Mainstream position:** No evidence of a previous advanced civilization; Göbekli Tepe represents the natural progression of Neolithic culture
- The Younger Dryas DID cause massive environmental upheaval — extinction of megafauna, flooding, climate shifts — regardless of interpretation

---

## 10. Connection to "The Watchers" and Garden of Eden Traditions

**Reliability: TIER 3 — SPECULATIVE** | **[Gemini, Master]**

### The Book of Enoch Parallel

- The Book of Enoch describes **"Watchers"** — beings who descended from heaven and taught humanity the arts of civilization (agriculture, metallurgy, astronomy, medicine, cosmetics)
- The sudden appearance of high masonry skills, symbolic art, and proto-agriculture in this specific region aligns with these mythic accounts of "gifted" knowledge
- The Watchers narrative precedes the Flood narrative — a pattern echoed in the Göbekli Tepe timeline (construction → catastrophe/burial)
- See → A04 (Book of Enoch), A07 (Apkallu & Seven Sages)

### Garden of Eden Geographic Correlation

- Some biblical geographers place the Garden of Eden in the headwaters region of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers
- Göbekli Tepe sits directly in this region — between ancient Mesopotamia and Anatolia
- The coincidence of the world's oldest temple complex, the birthplace of agriculture (einkorn domestication), and the traditional location of "Eden" in the same ~50 km radius is noted by multiple researchers
- **No textual evidence exists at Göbekli Tepe** to confirm or deny these connections
- This remains correlative geography, not archaeological proof

---

## 11. Göbekli Tepe and Serpent / Reptilian Connections

### Direct Evidence at the Site

- Serpent carvings are among the earliest and most prominent at the site
- Snakes appear in virtually every excavated enclosure
- The serpent is depicted alongside other potent symbols (vultures, scorpions, foxes)
- No clear narrative context is provided by the carvings alone — interpretation is open

### Broader Context

- Göbekli Tepe sits in the region between Mesopotamia (Sumerian civilization) and Anatolia
- The serpent's prominence at this early date (~9600 BCE) is consistent with the cross-cultural pattern of serpent beings as foundational symbols (see → C01, C08)
- Some researchers note the T-pillars could represent stylized guardian figures — similar to how **Ningishzida** ("Lord of the Good Tree") guards the entrance to the divine realm in Sumerian tradition (see → B06)
- The combination of serpent imagery and anthropomorphic pillars has been cited in later "serpent being" narratives

### What This Does NOT Prove

**[Claude]**

- Serpent carvings at Göbekli Tepe **do not prove** contact with reptilian beings
- Snake imagery in Neolithic art could represent **natural snake species** common in the region
- The carvings could be **totemic, protective, or cosmological** without implying non-human contact
- The connection to later Sumerian serpent mythology is **suggestive but not proven**
- There is **no explicit textual evidence** at the site — all interpretive frameworks are imposed from external traditions
- Interpretations remain speculative and symbolic **[5/5 SOURCES agree on this caution]**

## 12. Related Sites — The Taş Tepeler Network

**Reliability: TIER 1 — VERIFIED** | **[5/5 SOURCES]**

Göbekli Tepe is NOT alone. A cluster of at least **10–12 similar sites** exists in the Şanlıurfa region, collectively known as **Taş Tepeler** ("Stone Hills"):

### Karahan Tepe (~50 km SE of Göbekli Tepe)

- Discovered in 1997; major excavations began 2019 under Necmi Karul (Istanbul University)
- Similar T-shaped pillars but also unique features:
  - **Carved human heads** emerging from pillars
  - A room with **11 carved phallus-shaped pillars** surrounding a carved human head
  - More explicit human figures than Göbekli Tepe
- Possibly contemporary or slightly later than Göbekli Tepe
- Some structures appear even more complex than Göbekli Tepe
- Shows the T-pillar tradition was regional, not a single-site anomaly

### Boncuklu Tarla (~300 km east, Mardin Province)

- Excavations under Ergül Kodaş (Mardin Artuklu University) 2012–ongoing
- **Dated ~10,300–7,100 BCE — potentially OLDER than Göbekli Tepe's earliest layers** [RECENT]
- Contains T-shaped pillar fragments and communal buildings
- Suggests Pre-Pottery Neolithic monumental building tradition extends further east and earlier than previously known
- Important because it challenges Göbekli Tepe's status as the "first" — this may be a broader regional phenomenon [Tier 1]

### Sayburç — 2023 *Antiquity* Publication [RECENT]

- Excavated by Eylem Özdoğan (Istanbul University)
- Published in *Antiquity* May 2023 — a major rapid publication
- Features a dramatic **narrative relief panel**: a human figure grasping/flanking leopards, with a separate human holding a serpent and facing a bull [Tier 1]
- This is the **oldest known narrative scene** in the history of art — predating anything at Çatalhöyük [Tier 1]
- The serpent in this scene is held by a human figure in what appears to be a **non-threatening, possibly ceremonial context** — directly relevant to the project thesis [Tier 2]

### Other Taş Tepeler Sites

| Site | Key Features |
|------|-------------|
| **Nevalı Çori** | T-pillars and carved human heads; **destroyed by dam construction in 1992** |
| **Harbetsuvan Tepesi** | Bas-reliefs similar to Göbekli Tepe |
| **Sefer Tepe** | Part of the broader T-pillar network |
| **Hamzan Tepe** | Part of the broader T-pillar network |
| **Çakmaktepe** | Part of the broader T-pillar network |
| **Yeni Mahalle** | Part of the broader T-pillar network |

These sites suggest a **widespread Pre-Pottery Neolithic culture** across southeastern Turkey with shared architectural and symbolic traditions — not a single isolate but a regional civilization **[5/5 SOURCES]**.

---

## 13. Critical & Skeptical Perspectives

**[5/5 SOURCES]**

### What Is Not Disputed

- The site is extremely old (~9600 BCE minimum)
- The architecture required organized, coordinated labor
- It reshapes the understanding of early social complexity
- Serpents are among the most prominent carvings
- It was deliberately buried
- Only 5–10% has been excavated
- At least 10–12 similar sites exist in the region

### Mainstream Archaeology

- Sees Göbekli Tepe as a ritual/ceremonial center built by **sophisticated hunter-gatherers**
- Rejects claims of "advanced lost civilization" due to lack of supporting material culture **[5/5 SOURCES]**
- Klaus Schmidt himself never attributed it to non-human beings
- The carvings are consistent with Neolithic symbolic art found at other sites (Çatalhöyük, etc.)
- The "temple before agriculture" interpretation, while paradigm-shifting, doesn't require lost civilizations
- Jericho and other sites show parallel developments in the same period

### Alternative Views

- Engineering precision implies advanced knowledge or external instruction **[2/5 SOURCES]**
- The deliberate burial suggests intentional concealment **[2/5 SOURCES]**
- Astronomical encoding on Pillar 43 may record catastrophic events **[3/5 SOURCES]**
- Graham Hancock's "lost civilization" theory: Younger Dryas destroyed a predecessor culture; Göbekli Tepe represents survivors' knowledge preservation

### Counter-Arguments to Skepticism

- Mainstream archaeology has repeatedly had to revise its timelines downward as new evidence emerges
- The sophistication of the site DID genuinely surprise the archaeological community
- The deliberate burial remains unusual regardless of explanation
- The 90–95% unexcavated portion could contain significant surprises
- The cluster of 10–12+ similar sites suggests a widespread organized culture not yet well understood

### Logical Caution

- **"God of the Gaps" fallacy** — "We don't fully understand it, therefore aliens/lost civilization" mirrors "We don't understand lightning, therefore Zeus" **[Claude]**
- Many ancient sites were backfilled for mundane reasons (foundations for new buildings, ritual decommissioning)
- The Sweatman comet interpretation has been challenged by other archaeoastronomers
- Hancock's theory lacks direct archaeological evidence

## 14. Active Research Questions

**[Claude]**

Seven major open questions guide ongoing research:

1. **Purpose:** What was the site's specific function? (Temple? Meeting place? Astronomical observatory? Seasonal pilgrimage site? Combination?)
2. **Burial motive:** Why was it deliberately buried? What triggered the decision?
3. **Enclosure relationships:** What is the relationship between the different enclosures? (Chronological sequence? Clan-based territories? Functional differentiation?)
4. **Symbolic meaning:** What do the animal symbols specifically represent? (Totemic? Cosmological? Astronomical? Narrative?)
5. **Social organization:** How were the builders organized? (Who led? How were workers fed without agriculture?)
6. **Unexcavated 90–95%:** What does the remaining buried portion contain? (Domestic quarters? Additional enclosures? Burials? Artifacts?)
7. **Agriculture origin:** What is the precise relationship between Göbekli Tepe and the emergence of agriculture in this region?

**Status: Active excavation and research** — large GPR survey potential remains; <10% excavated **[Raptor]**.
