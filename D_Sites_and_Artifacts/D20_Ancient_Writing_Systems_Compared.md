## QUICK SUMMARY

The **invention of writing** — the transition from oral to literate civilization — is among humanity's most consequential technological achievements. Yet its origins remain debated: was writing invented **once** and diffused, or did it arise **independently** in multiple locations? The evidence supports **at least four independent inventions**: Mesopotamian **cuneiform** (~3400 BCE → A01), Egyptian **hieroglyphs** (~3200 BCE → A14), Chinese **oracle bone script** (~1200 BCE, possibly earlier), and Mesoamerican **Maya glyphs** (~300 BCE → C38). Additionally, several scripts remain **undeciphered** — including the **Indus Valley script** (~2600 BCE → C52), **Linear A** (~1800 BCE → C42), **Rongorongo** of Easter Island (→ C37), and the **Phaistos Disc** — each representing potentially lost literate civilizations whose knowledge remains locked behind unreadable symbols. The development from **pictographic** to **logographic** to **syllabic** to **alphabetic** systems traces a path from representing things to representing sounds — culminating in the **Phoenician/Proto-Sinaitic alphabet** (~1800 BCE), ancestor of virtually all modern alphabets (Greek, Latin, Arabic, Hebrew, Indic scripts). This document surveys the world's major writing systems as **artifacts** revealing the cognitive and organizational capabilities of ancient civilizations.

## 1. THE INVENTION OF WRITING — MULTIPLE ORIGINS?

### 1.1 Proto-Writing vs. True Writing [5/5 sources]

| System | Date | Type | True Writing? |
|--------|------|------|--------------|
| **Jiahu symbols** (China) | ~6600 BCE | Incised marks on tortoise shells | Debated — possibly proto-writing |
| **Vinča symbols** (Balkans) | ~5500 BCE | Symbols on ceramics | Probably not — no evidence of language encoding |
| **Tărtăria tablets** (Romania) | ~5300 BCE | Symbols resembling Sumerian | Controversial — context disputed |
| **Clay tokens** (Mesopotamia) | ~8000–3500 BCE | Accounting tokens in clay envelopes | Proto-writing → evolves into cuneiform |
| **Proto-cuneiform** (Uruk) | ~3400 BCE | Pictographic signs on clay tablets | **Yes** — earliest confirmed writing |
| **Egyptian hieroglyphs** | ~3200 BCE | Tomb inscriptions (Abydos) | **Yes** — possibly independent invention |

### 1.2 Definitions [4/5 sources]

**True writing** must encode **language** — not just convey meaning through pictures:
- Must represent the **sounds or morphemes** of a specific language
- Must be **productive** — able to express any thought the language can express
- Must have **conventional signs** (not just recognizable pictures)

## 2. CUNEIFORM — MESOPOTAMIA

### 2.1 Development (~3400–75 CE) [5/5 sources]

| Phase | Date | Features |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Proto-cuneiform** | ~3400–3000 BCE | ~1,500 pictographic signs; primarily accounting (Uruk) |
| **Early cuneiform** | ~3000–2600 BCE | Signs rotated 90°; becoming abstract; phonetic values develop |
| **Old Babylonian** | ~2000–1600 BCE | ~600 signs; fully phonetic capability; literature (Gilgamesh, Atrahasis → A01) |
| **Neo-Assyrian** | ~1000–600 BCE | Standardized sign forms; Ashurbanipal's library |
| **Late Babylonian** | ~600 BCE–75 CE | Specialized astronomical/mathematical use; dies out vs. Aramaic |

### 2.2 How Cuneiform Works [5/5 sources]

- **Medium:** Wedge-shaped impressions in wet clay using a reed stylus
- **Sign types:** Logograms (word-signs) + syllabograms (sound-signs) + determinatives (category markers)
- **Languages written:** Sumerian, Akkadian, Hittite, Elamite, Hurrian, Ugaritic, Old Persian
- **Decipherment:** Henry Rawlinson at Behistun (1835–1847) — trilingual inscription (Old Persian, Elamite, Babylonian)
- **Corpus:** ~500,000 tablets recovered; majority still unstudied/unpublished

### 2.3 What Cuneiform Preserved [4/5 sources]

- **Literature:** Epic of Gilgamesh, Enuma Elish, Atrahasis
- **Law:** Code of Hammurabi (~1750 BCE)
- **Science:** Mathematical tables (Plimpton 322 — Pythagorean triples), astronomical diaries
- **Administration:** Tens of thousands of economic/bureaucratic records
- **Medicine:** Diagnostic handbooks, pharmaceutical lists
- **Diplomacy:** Amarna Letters (international correspondence ~1350 BCE)

## 3. EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPHS

### 3.1 System Overview [5/5 sources]

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Date range** | ~3200 BCE – 394 CE (last known hieroglyphic inscription: Temple of Isis, Philae) |
| **Sign count** | ~750 in classical usage; ~6,000+ by Ptolemaic period |
| **Sign types** | Logograms + phonograms (uniliteral, biliteral, triliteral) + determinatives |
| **Direction** | Read toward the faces of animal/human signs (right-to-left, left-to-right, or top-to-bottom) |
| **Related scripts** | **Hieratic** (cursive, for daily use); **Demotic** (even more cursive, late period); **Coptic** (Egyptian + Greek alphabet) |

### 3.2 Decipherment [5/5 sources]

- **Rosetta Stone** (196 BCE) — trilingual decree in Hieroglyphic, Demotic, Greek
- Discovered 1799 by French soldier during Napoleon's Egyptian campaign
- **Jean-François Champollion** (1822) — cracked the code by recognizing hieroglyphs as both phonetic AND logographic
- Key insight: cartouches containing royal names (Ptolemy, Cleopatra) provided phonetic values
- Thomas Young contributed preliminary phonetic analysis

### 3.3 The Pyramid Texts (→ A14) [4/5 sources]

The **oldest religious texts in the world** (~2400 BCE) — inscribed in hieroglyphs inside pyramids at Saqqara. These "Utterances" contain spells for the pharaoh's afterlife journey, representing the earliest substantial body of Egyptian religious literature.

## 4. INDUS VALLEY SCRIPT

### 4.1 The Great Undeciphered Script (→ C52) [5/5 sources]

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Date** | ~2600–1900 BCE |
| **Signs** | ~400–600 distinct symbols |
| **Corpus** | ~4,200 inscribed objects (mostly seals) |
| **Average inscription length** | ~5 signs (very short) |
| **Direction** | Right to left (based on sign compression) |
| **Status** | **UNDECIPHERED** — the subject of 100+ decipherment attempts |

### 4.2 Why It Resists Decipherment [5/5 sources]

| Obstacle | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| **Short texts** | Average 5 signs — too brief for statistical analysis or pattern recognition |
| **No bilingual** | No "Rosetta Stone" equivalent found |
| **Unknown language** | Candidates: Proto-Dravidian, early Indo-Aryan, language isolate, or not language at all |
| **Debate: Is it writing?** | Farmer, Sproat, & Witzel (2004) argued it may not encode language — possibly a symbol system like heraldry |
| **Counter-argument** | Rao et al. (2009) showed statistical properties similar to linguistic scripts, not non-linguistic symbol systems |

## 5. CHINESE ORACLE BONES AND CHARACTERS

### 5.1 Oracle Bone Script (~1200 BCE) [5/5 sources]

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Medium** | Ox scapulae and turtle plastrons |
| **Purpose** | Pyromantic divination — heat-crack patterns interpreted as answers from ancestors/spirits |
| **Signs** | ~4,500 distinct characters; ~1,500 identified with later Chinese characters |
| **Discovery** | 1899 — bones being sold as "dragon bones" for traditional medicine in Beijing pharmacies |
| **Corpus** | ~150,000 bone fragments recovered |
| **Script type** | Logographic with phonetic elements (same principle as modern Chinese) |

### 5.2 Continuity — The World's Longest-Running Writing System [4/5 sources]

Chinese is the **only writing system in continuous use since its Bronze Age origins**:
- Oracle bones (~1200 BCE) → Bronze inscriptions → Small Seal Script (Qin standardization, 221 BCE) → Clerical →Regular → Simplified (1956)
- Modern Chinese readers can partially read 2,000-year-old texts
- ~50,000+ characters total; ~3,500 needed for literacy

| **Type** | Logo-syllabic (logograms + syllable signs) |
| **Sign count** | ~800 glyphs |
| **Medium** | Stone monuments, ceramics, codices (bark-paper books) |
| **Codices surviving** | Only 4 (Dresden, Madrid, Paris, Grolier) — rest destroyed by Spanish |
| **Decipherment** | Yuri Knorosov (1952) — identified syllabic values; full reading achieved ~1980s-1990s |

## 7. MEDITERRANEAN SCRIPTS — LINEAR A, LINEAR B, PHOENICIAN

### 7.1 Comparison Table [5/5 sources]

| Script | Date | Location | Type | Status |
|--------|------|----------|------|--------|
| **Cretan Hieroglyphic** | ~2100–1700 BCE | Crete | Undetermined | Undeciphered |
| **Linear A** | ~1800–1450 BCE | Minoan Crete (→ C42) | Syllabary | **Undeciphered** — language unknown |
| **Linear B** | ~1450–1200 BCE | Mycenaean Greece & Crete | Syllabary | **Deciphered** (Michael Ventris, 1952) — records archaic Greek |
| **Cypro-Minoan** | ~1550–1050 BCE | Cyprus | Undetermined | Undeciphered |
| **Phoenician** | ~1050 BCE onward | Lebanon/Mediterranean | Consonantal alphabet (abjad) | Fully known — ancestor of Greek, Latin, Arabic, Hebrew alphabets |
| **Proto-Sinaitic** | ~1800 BCE | Sinai/Levant | Consonantal signs from Egyptian models | Partially deciphered — ancestor of Phoenician |

### 7.2 The Alphabet Revolution [5/5 sources]

The invention of the **alphabet** (~1800 BCE) was one of the most consequential in human history:
1. **Proto-Sinaitic** (~1800 BCE): Semitic-speaking workers adapted ~22 Egyptian hieroglyphs to represent consonants (acrophonic principle: picture of "house" [*bayt*] = /b/)
2. **Phoenician** (~1050 BCE): Standardized the consonantal alphabet; spread through Mediterranean trade
3. **Greek** (~800 BCE): Added **vowels** — first true alphabet (consonants + vowels). Adapted Phoenician signs for vowel sounds (aleph → alpha/A, he → epsilon/E)
4. **Latin** (~600 BCE): Adapted from Greek via Etruscan → becomes the world's most widely used script
5. **Aramaic** → Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, and ultimately → Brahmi → all Indian/Southeast Asian scripts

One invention → virtually every alphabet on Earth.

| **Indus script** | ~2600–1900 BCE | Pakistan/India | ~4,200 objects | Short texts; unknown language |
| **Linear A** | ~1800–1450 BCE | Crete | ~1,400 inscriptions | Unknown language; syllabic values from Linear B applied but translations fail |
| **Proto-Elamite** | ~3100–2900 BCE | Iran | ~1,600 tablets | Administrative; partially understood but not "read" |
| **Rongorongo** | ~1200–1860s CE? | Easter Island (→ C37) | 26 surviving objects | Tiny corpus; no bilingual; script may be recent |
| **Phaistos Disc** | ~1700 BCE | Crete | 1 object only | Unique — no other examples; may be a forgery or import |
| **Cypro-Minoan** | ~1550–1050 BCE | Cyprus | ~250 inscriptions | Unknown language(s); possibly multiple scripts |

### 8.2 The Phaistos Disc — Genuine or Forgery? [4/5 sources]

Found in 1908 at Phaistos, Crete — a fired clay disc with 241 stamped symbols in 45 distinct types arranged in a spiral:
- Signs were **stamped** with pre-made punches — possibly the world's first "movable type"
- No other example of this script has ever been found
- Jerome Eisenberg (2008) argued it may be a forgery by Luigi Pernier (the discoverer)
- Most scholars accept authenticity but acknowledge it cannot be read without more examples

## 9. COUNTER-ARGUMENTS AND SCHOLARLY DEBATE

| Claim | Supporting Evidence | Counter-Evidence | Assessment |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| Writing was independently invented multiple times | Cuneiform, Chinese, Maya geographically isolated; structurally different | Egyptian may have been inspired by awareness of Sumerian writing (stimulus diffusion) | **Tier 1** — at least 3 independent inventions widely accepted |
| Indus script encodes language | Statistical regularities match linguistic scripts; positional patterns | Very short texts; could be a non-linguistic symbol system | **Tier 2** — majority view: probably writing, but not proven |
| Proto-Sinaitic alphabet derives from Egyptian | Acrophonic values map Egyptian signs to Semitic consonants | Some sign correspondences debated; dating uncertain | **Tier 1** — broad scholarly consensus |
| There may be undiscovered/destroyed writing systems | Maya codices burned by Spanish; Chinese bamboo texts decomposed; oral cultures may have had now-lost scripts | Absence of evidence ≠ evidence of absence, but is not positive evidence either | **Tier 2** — plausible but speculative |
| Vinča symbols are Europe's oldest writing | Pre-date cuneiform by ~2,000 years | Do not encode language; no sequential texts; probably symbolic marks | **Tier 3** — not considered true writing by consensus |
