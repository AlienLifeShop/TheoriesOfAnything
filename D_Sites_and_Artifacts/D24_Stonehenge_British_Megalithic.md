## QUICK SUMMARY

Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire, is Britain's most iconic prehistoric monument, constructed in multiple phases between approximately 3100 and 1500 BCE — a span of over 1,600 years. The site features massive sarsen stones (up to 25 tonnes) dressed with mortise-and-tenon and tongue-and-groove joints carved into solid rock, as well as 80+ bluestones transported approximately 240 km from the Preseli Hills of Wales by means still fiercely debated. The 56 Aubrey Holes may encode eclipse-prediction capabilities linked to Saros-related cycles (→ D19). Stonehenge is not an isolated monument but the centerpiece of a vast ritual landscape including Woodhenge, Durrington Walls, the Cursus, and the recently discovered Bluestonehenge (2008), all connected by processional avenues. Acoustic research has demonstrated that certain stones ring like bells when struck — "lithophones" — raising questions about sonic ritual dimensions (→ J07).

## 1. VERIFIED CLAIMS (Tier 1 — Peer-Reviewed / Archaeological Record)

### 1.1 Multiple Construction Phases [5/5 sources]
- **Phase 1 (~3100 BCE):** Circular ditch-and-bank enclosure (henge), 56 Aubrey Holes dug around the perimeter; cremation burials deposited in and around the holes.
- **Phase 2 (~3000–2620 BCE):** Timber structures erected within the enclosure; evidence of post-hole alignments; continued cremation burials (the largest Neolithic cremation cemetery in Britain — ~150 individuals identified).
- **Phase 3a (~2620–2480 BCE):** Bluestones first erected in Q and R Holes arrangement; later dismantled and rearranged multiple times.
- **Phase 3b (~2480–2280 BCE):** Sarsen circle and trilithon horseshoe erected — the iconic silhouette. Stones dressed, shaped, and jointed with remarkable precision.
- **Phase 3c (~2280–1500 BCE):** Bluestones rearranged into present circle and horseshoe; Avenue constructed linking Stonehenge to the River Avon; Y and Z Holes dug but never filled with stones.

### 1.2 Sarsen Stone Engineering [5/5 sources]
- 52 sarsen stones survive (originally ~75), quarried from Marlborough Downs (~25 km north).
- Largest sarsen (Stone 56): ~6.7m tall above ground, ~2.4m buried, weighing ~25 tonnes.
- Stones dressed smooth using mauls (pounding stones) of sarsen — thousands of maul fragments found on-site.
- **Mortise-and-tenon joints:** Raised knobs on uprights fit into carved sockets on lintels — a woodworking technique executed in stone.
- **Tongue-and-groove joints:** Lintels locked to each other laterally — unique in megalithic architecture.
- Lintels slightly curved on both inner and outer faces — cut to form a true circle.

### 1.3 Bluestone Transport [5/5 sources]
- 80+ bluestones (spotted dolerite, rhyolite, volcanic ash) traced petrologically to specific outcrops in the Preseli Hills, Pembrokeshire, Wales — ~240 km from Stonehenge.
- Average bluestone weight: 2–5 tonnes; some up to ~8 tonnes.
- **Glacial transport hypothesis (Kellaway 1971; revised by others):** Glaciers carried stones partway; humans completed the journey. Contested — no glacial erratics found on Salisbury Plain.
- **Human transport hypothesis (Atkinson, Parker Pearson):** Stones moved by raft along the Welsh coast and up the Bristol Avon, then over land. Experimental archaeology has demonstrated feasibility with Neolithic technology.
- **Craig Rhos-y-felin quarry (2011–2015, Parker Pearson et al.):** Identified specific quarry sites with evidence of stone extraction; proto-orthostat found in situ; radiocarbon dates suggest quarrying ~3400–3200 BCE (predating erection at Stonehenge).

### 1.4 Durrington Walls and Companion Sites [4/5 sources]
- **Durrington Walls (~2500 BCE):** Largest known henge in Britain (diameter ~500m); contained timber circles (Southern Circle, Northern Circle) mirroring Stonehenge's layout in wood.
- **Woodhenge (~2300 BCE):** Six concentric rings of timber posts, 800m from Stonehenge; burial of a child with cleft skull at center (sacrifice?).
- **The Cursus (~3630–3370 BCE):** 3 km-long linear earthwork; purpose unknown — processional? boundary?
- Parker Pearson's "domain of the living/domain of the dead" model: Durrington Walls (timber, feasting, living) connected by the Avon to Stonehenge (stone, death, ancestors).

## 2. CREDIBLE CLAIMS (Tier 2 — Academic / Debated but Supported)

### 2.1 Astronomical Alignments [4/5 sources]
- **Solstice axis:** The Avenue and the monument's main axis align with the midsummer sunrise (NE) and midwinter sunset (SW). This is the only alignment accepted by most archaeoastronomers.
- **Aubrey Holes as eclipse predictor:** Gerald Hawkins (*Stonehenge Decoded*, 1965) proposed the 56 holes could track the 18.61-year lunar nodal cycle (3 × 18.67 ≈ 56). By moving markers around the ring, eclipses could be predicted. Fred Hoyle refined this model.
- Debated: Clive Ruggles and others argue the astronomical precision claimed by Hawkins is overstated, but accept the solstice alignment as intentional and significant.

### 2.2 Acoustic and Lithophone Properties [3/5 sources]
- Research by the Royal College of Art (Devereux & Jahn, 2001; Till, 2010) demonstrated that certain bluestones ring with clear tones when struck — functioning as natural lithophones.
- Some Preseli outcrops are known locally as "ringing rocks" (maenclochog = "ringing stones" in Welsh).
- Hypothesis: Acoustic properties were a factor in bluestone selection — stones chosen specifically for their sonic qualities (→ J07).
- Interior acoustics: Sound reflections within the sarsen circle create standing waves; speech at certain points carries anomalously well.

### 2.3 Bluestonehenge Discovery (2008) [3/5 sources]
- Discovered by the Stonehenge Riverside Project (Parker Pearson et al.) at West Amesbury, at the Avon end of the Avenue.
- Henge with ~25 stone sockets arranged in circle; bluestones removed in antiquity (possibly relocated to Stonehenge itself).
- Interpretation: A "reception" monument at the river landing — part of a processional route linking water to stone.

### 2.4 Healing Monument Hypothesis [3/5 sources]
- Timothy Darvill and Geoffrey Wainwright proposed that Stonehenge was a place of healing — a "Neolithic Lourdes."
- Evidence: High proportion of individuals buried nearby show signs of illness or injury; some came from distant regions (isotope analysis of the "Amesbury Archer" shows Alpine origin).
- Bluestones in particular may have been attributed healing powers (springs near Preseli outcrops had sacred associations).

## 3. SPECULATIVE CLAIMS (Tier 3 — Possible but Unverified)

### 3.1 Unified Cosmological Model [2/5 sources]
- Some researchers propose Stonehenge encoded a complete cosmological model: the sarsen circle = the visible sky; the horseshoe trilithons = the underworld; the bluestones = ancestors or mediating spirits.
- No direct evidence from the builders survives to confirm symbolic interpretations.

### 3.2 Connection to a Broader Megalithic Network [2/5 sources]
- Stonehenge, Avebury, and the Dorset Cursus may form part of a planned ritual landscape spanning hundreds of square kilometers.
- Ley line theorists (Alfred Watkins, 1921) claimed Stonehenge sits on alignments of ancient sites — regarded as pseudoarchaeology by mainstream scholars, but the density of Neolithic/Bronze Age monuments in the region is genuinely extraordinary (→ O01).

### 3.3 Sound-Based Construction Assistance [1/5 sources]
- Fringe hypothesis that acoustic levitation or resonance-based techniques aided stone transport.
- No supporting archaeological evidence; the physics of acoustic levitation does not scale to multi-tonne objects with known mechanisms.

---

## 4. DUBIOUS CLAIMS (Tier 4 — No Credible Source)

### 4.1 Merlin and the Giants' Dance [0/5 sources]
- Geoffrey of Monmouth (*Historia Regum Britanniae*, ~1136 CE) claimed the wizard Merlin magically transported the stones from Ireland (originally brought there from Africa by giants).
- Interesting as medieval folklore; no historical basis. However, it loosely preserves the tradition that the stones "came from far away," which is factually correct.

### 4.2 Extraterrestrial Construction [0/5 sources]
- No credible evidence supports alien involvement. The engineering, while impressive, is within Neolithic human capability as demonstrated by experimental archaeology. The multi-phase, multi-century construction timeline is itself evidence of incremental human effort, not a single advanced intervention.

### 4.3 Atlantean Origin [0/5 sources]
- Claims linking Stonehenge to Atlantis lack any archaeological, geological, or textual support and are not taken seriously in academic literature.
