## QUICK SUMMARY

The moai of Rapa Nui (Easter Island) are among the most recognizable monumental sculptures on Earth: 887 statues carved from compressed volcanic tuff at the Rano Raraku quarry, averaging 4m tall and 12.5 tonnes, with the largest unfinished statue ("El Gigante") reaching 21m and an estimated 270 tonnes. The statues were placed on megalithic stone platforms called ahu, facing inland (toward the communities they protected), many topped with red scoria pukao (topknots). How these statues were transported up to 18 km from the quarry remains debated, though the "walking moai" hypothesis (Hunt & Lipo, 2011) — rocking the statues upright with ropes — has gained significant traction. The island also preserves rongorongo, one of only a handful of independently invented writing systems in human history, which remains undeciphered. The causes of Rapa Nui's demographic and ecological crisis before European contact are contested between Jared Diamond's "ecocide" model and Hunt & Lipo's "colonial rat-destruction" alternative.

## 1. VERIFIED CLAIMS (Tier 1 — Peer-Reviewed / Archaeological Record)

### 1.1 Moai Statistics and Quarrying [5/5 sources]
- **887 moai** cataloged on Rapa Nui (Easter Island Statue Project, Van Tilburg, 1994–present).
- Nearly all (~95%) carved from compressed volcanic tuff (lapilli tuff) at **Rano Raraku** quarry — the volcanic crater where ~397 moai remain in various stages of completion (quarried, partially carved, or abandoned in transit).
- **Average dimensions:** ~4m tall, ~12.5 tonnes. Range: 1.13m (smallest completed) to 9.8m (largest erected on an ahu — Ahu Te Pito Kura).
- **El Gigante (Te Tokanga):** Unfinished statue still attached to bedrock at Rano Raraku — 21.6m long, estimated 145–270 tonnes. Never separated from the quarry.
- Carving tools: basalt toki (hand picks) — thousands recovered from the quarry. Experimental archaeology confirms one moai could be roughed out in 12–18 months by a team of 15–20 carvers.

### 1.2 Ahu Platforms [5/5 sources]
- **Ahu:** Rectangular stone platforms (some over 100m long) built along the coastline, serving as foundations for moai and as burial sites.
- ~300 ahu identified; ~125 originally supported moai.
- Construction: Fitted basalt and scoria blocks, with rubble fill cores; some show remarkably tight joint fitting (though not as precise as Inca or Tiwanaku work — → M03).
- **Ahu Tongariki:** Largest ahu, 220m long, supporting 15 moai (re-erected 1992–1995 by Chilean archaeologists with Japanese crane assistance).
- **Ahu Vinapu:** Notable for Inca-style fitted stonework; has been cited as evidence of South American contact (debated — → C38).

### 1.3 Pukao (Topknots/Headdresses) [4/5 sources]
- ~100 pukao carved from red scoria (volcanic rock) quarried at **Puna Pau** crater (separate from Rano Raraku).
- Cylindrical shape; weight: 1.5–12+ tonnes; placed atop moai heads.
- Transport and placement: Recent experimental and computational studies (Sean Hixon et al., 2018) suggest pukao were rolled to ahu sites and then "parbuckled" (levered up incrementally using ramps) onto already-erected moai.

### 1.4 Settlement Chronology [4/5 sources]
- Initial Polynesian colonization: ~1200 CE (revised upward from earlier estimates of ~400–800 CE; based on radiocarbon recalibration — Hunt & Lipo, 2006).
- Peak moai construction: ~1400–1600 CE.
- Moai construction ceased by ~1600–1650 CE; many statues toppled during inter-clan conflicts (huri moai period).
- European contact: Jacob Roggeveen, Easter Sunday 1722 (hence the name); islanders described as ~2,000–3,000 at that time.

### 1.5 Birdman Cult (Tangata Manu) [3/5 sources]
- After moai construction ended, the island's ritual focus shifted to the Birdman cult centered at Orongo village on the rim of Rano Kau crater.
- Annual competition: representatives of island clans raced to retrieve the first egg of the sooty tern from the offshore islet of Motu Nui.
- The winner's clan chief became the tangata manu (Birdman) with ritual authority for one year.
- Extensive petroglyphs of Makemake (creator deity) and birdman figures at Orongo.

## 2. CREDIBLE CLAIMS (Tier 2 — Academic / Debated but Supported)

### 2.1 "Walking Moai" Transport Theory [4/5 sources]
- **Hunt & Lipo (2011):** Proposed moai were transported upright ("walked") by rocking them side to side using ropes pulled by teams of workers — like walking a refrigerator.
- Experimental validation (Hunt, Lipo & National Geographic, 2011): A 4.4-tonne replica moai was successfully "walked" 100m using three rope teams (two on sides, one behind).
- Consistent with the Rapa Nui oral tradition: "The statues walked" (te moai e haere).
- Explains the pattern of fallen moai along ancient roads (face-down = fell forward during transport).
- **However:** Larger moai (>20 tonnes) would be much harder to walk; alternative methods (sledges, log rollers, A-frame cradles) may have been used for the heaviest examples.

### 2.2 Ecocide vs. Rat-Destruction Debate [4/5 sources]
- **Ecocide model (Diamond, *Collapse*, 2005):** Population grew to 15,000+; unsustainable deforestation (for moai transport logs, agriculture, canoes) caused ecological collapse, food shortage, warfare, cannibalism, and cultural disintegration before European contact.
- **Rat-destruction model (Hunt & Lipo, 2006, 2011):** Polynesian rats (Rattus exulans), introduced with the first settlers, consumed palm seeds, preventing forest regeneration. Deforestation was primarily rat-driven, not human-driven. Population was never as high as Diamond claimed (~3,000–4,000 max). Society was relatively stable until European diseases, slave raids (1862), and livestock destroyed the community.
- **Current consensus:** Most scholars accept a combination — human land use AND rat predation contributed to deforestation. The scale and timing of population decline remain debated.

### 2.3 Rongorongo Script [3/5 sources]
- 26 surviving artifacts bearing rongorongo glyphs (wooden tablets, staffs, and a reimiro ornament), most in European museums.
- **Undeciphered:** Despite numerous attempts (Barthel, 1958; Fischer, 1997; others), no verified decipherment exists.
- Potentially one of only ~4–5 independent inventions of writing in human history (along with Sumerian, Chinese, Mesoamerican, and possibly Indus Valley).
- Some scholars argue rongorongo may be a post-European-contact invention (inspired by seeing Spanish written documents); others maintain it predates contact based on wood radiocarbon dates — the question is unresolved.
- Boustrophedon form: alternating lines read in opposite directions, with glyphs inverted every other line — unique (→ D20).

### 2.4 Moai as Ancestor Representations [4/5 sources]
- The moai almost certainly represented deified ancestors (ariki/chiefs) whose spiritual power (mana) was believed to radiate from the statues onto the land and communities behind them.
- Moai all face inland (toward the village), not out to sea — they protect the living, not watch the ocean.
- Eyes: Coral and red scoria eye inlays have been found; when eyes were inserted, the statue was "activated" (imbued with mana).

## 3. SPECULATIVE CLAIMS (Tier 3 — Possible but Unverified)

### 3.1 South American Contact [2/5 sources]
- Sweet potato (kumara) was cultivated on Rapa Nui before European contact — a South American crop. DNA analysis confirms the pre-Columbian transfer.
- Ahu Vinapu's fitted stonework has been compared to Inca masonry.
- Thor Heyerdahl's Kon-Tiki expedition (1947) demonstrated Pacific crossing from South America was possible.
- However, genetic, linguistic, and archaeological evidence overwhelmingly supports West-to-East Polynesian colonization (→ C38). Limited contact with South America is plausible but was not the primary cultural input.

### 3.2 Moai Eye Activation and Ritual Power [2/5 sources]
- Hypothesis that moai were ritually "activated" and "deactivated" by inserting/removing eye inlays — like turning on/off a spiritual power source.
- Supported by ethnographic analogy from Polynesia and the finding of eye fragments, but direct ritual protocols are not documented.

### 3.3 Acoustic Properties of Moai [1/5 sources]
- Some researchers have noted that Rano Raraku tuff has acoustic resonance properties.
- Limited study; not yet confirmed or replicated in peer-reviewed literature.

## 4. DUBIOUS CLAIMS (Tier 4 — No Credible Source)

### 4.1 Extraterrestrial Construction [0/5 sources]
- No evidence. Quarry marks, unfinished statues in every stage of production, toki tools by the thousands, and feasible experimental replications all demonstrate human craftsmanship.

### 4.2 Lemurian / Mu Origin [0/5 sources]
- Claims that Rapa Nui is a remnant of a lost continent (Mu/Lemuria) have no geological or archaeological basis. The island is a volcanic peak formed ~750,000 years ago; human occupation dates to ~1200 CE.

### 4.3 Levitation / Anti-Gravity Transport [0/5 sources]
- Some fringe writers interpret "the statues walked" literally as evidence of telekinesis or advanced technology. Oral traditions use metaphor and poetic language; the "walking" describes a transport technique, as experimentally demonstrated.
