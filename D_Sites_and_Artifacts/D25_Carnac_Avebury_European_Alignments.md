## QUICK SUMMARY

Europe's megalithic tradition extends from Portugal to Scandinavia and spans roughly 4800–1500 BCE, encompassing thousands of stone circles, standing stones (menhirs), stone rows, dolmens, and passage tombs. The Carnac alignments in Brittany — over 3,000 standing stones stretching 4 km in parallel rows — represent the densest concentration of megaliths anywhere on Earth. Avebury in Wiltshire encloses an entire village within the largest stone circle in the world (diameter ~330m). Scotland's Ring of Brodgar and Callanish, Portugal's Almendres Cromlech, and hundreds of lesser-known sites form a continental network whose builders shared no known common written language. Alexander Thom's controversial hypothesis of a "Megalithic Yard" (2.72 feet) as a standard unit of measurement used across this vast area has sparked decades of statistical debate and remains unresolved.

## 1. VERIFIED CLAIMS (Tier 1 — Peer-Reviewed / Archaeological Record)

### 1.1 Carnac Stone Rows (Brittany, France) [5/5 sources]
- Located near Carnac, Morbihan, Brittany; constructed ~4500–3300 BCE.
- Three main alignments:
  - **Le Ménec:** 1,099 standing stones in 11 rows, stretching 1,165m; terminated by stone circles (cromlechs) at each end.
  - **Kermario:** 1,029 stones in 10 rows, stretching 1,120m; includes the tallest menhir at Carnac (~4m).
  - **Kerlescan:** 555 stones in 13 rows, 880m long; preceded by a 39-stone semicircle.
- Other groups: Le Petit Ménec (less well-preserved), and scattered individual menhirs.
- Total stones in the Carnac area: 3,000+ surviving (original count estimated higher; medieval road-building and agriculture destroyed many).
- **Purpose unknown:** No definitive archaeological explanation. Hypotheses include ritual processional ways, astronomical calendars, territorial markers, and ancestor commemoration.

### 1.2 Avebury Henge and Stone Circle (Wiltshire, England) [5/5 sources]
- Constructed ~2850–2200 BCE; UNESCO World Heritage Site (with Stonehenge).
- **Largest stone circle in the world:** Outer circle ~330m diameter, originally ~98 standing stones (many destroyed in 17th–18th centuries; some buried, some broken up for building material).
- Ditch and bank: Ditch up to 9m deep, bank up to 5.5m high — enclosing ~11.5 hectares.
- **Two inner circles:** Northern inner ring (27 stones, including the Cove — three massive sarsens) and Southern inner ring (29 stones, with central obelisk now destroyed).
- **West Kennet Avenue:** Processional avenue of paired stones linking Avebury to The Sanctuary on Overton Hill (~2.4 km).
- **Silbury Hill:** Largest artificial mound in Europe, 30m high, dating ~2400 BCE; purpose uncertain — located near Avebury.
- Alexander Keiller's excavations (1930s) re-erected many fallen stones and documented medieval destruction.

### 1.3 Ring of Brodgar (Orkney, Scotland) [4/5 sources]
- Neolithic stone circle on the isthmus between Loch of Harray and Loch of Stenness, Orkney; ~2500–2000 BCE.
- Originally ~60 stones (27 survive); circle diameter ~104m — the third-largest stone circle in Britain.
- Part of the Heart of Neolithic Orkney UNESCO site (with Skara Brae, Maeshowe, Stones of Stenness).
- Surrounding ditch: 3m deep, 10m wide, cut into solid bedrock — estimated 80,000 person-hours of labor.
- Ness of Brodgar: Major excavations (2003–present) revealed a monumental Neolithic complex between Brodgar and Stenness — massive stone-built structures, painted walls, ritual feasting deposits.

### 1.4 Callanish Standing Stones (Isle of Lewis, Scotland) [4/5 sources]
- Main site (Callanish I): cruciform setting of 13 stones forming a circle (diameter ~12m) with stone rows extending in four directions (the longest: ~83m avenue to the north).
- Erected ~2900–2600 BCE; surrounded by at least 20 satellite stone settings.
- Peat growth buried stones up to 1.5m by 1857 (when Sir James Matheson had them cleared).

### 1.5 Almendres Cromlech (Évora, Portugal) [3/5 sources]
- Largest group of structured menhirs on the Iberian Peninsula; ~6000–4000 BCE (among the oldest megalithic structures in Europe).
- 95 monoliths arranged in two ellipses; some bear carved circles, cup marks, and possible axe or staff representations.
- Aligned with sunrise positions at solstices and equinoxes.

## 2. CREDIBLE CLAIMS (Tier 2 — Academic / Debated but Supported)

### 2.1 Alexander Thom's Megalithic Yard [3/5 sources]
- Oxford professor of engineering Alexander Thom (1894–1985) surveyed over 300 stone circles and alignments across Britain and Brittany from the 1930s to 1970s.
- Proposed a standard unit of measurement: the **Megalithic Yard (MY) = 2.720 ± 0.003 feet (0.829m)** used consistently across sites thousands of kilometers and centuries apart.
- Also proposed a **Megalithic Rod (MR) = 2.5 MY** and a **Megalithic Fathom = 2 MY**.
- Claimed many circles were not true circles but **egg shapes, flattened circles, and ellipses** — constructed using integer multiples of the MY and Pythagorean triangles.
- **Debate:**
  - Supporters (Thom, C.L.N. Ruggles initially, Clive Ruggles later partially): Statistical analysis shows the MY is more consistent than chance would predict.
  - Critics (D.G. Kendall, 1974; Barnatt & Moir, 1984): Argued Thom's methods were biased (selection of diameters, post hoc choices of geometry); randomized tests reduce effect to non-significant levels.
  - Current status: No consensus. The idea of local or regional measurement standards is accepted; a universal MY across all of Atlantic Europe is not widely endorsed.

### 2.2 Astronomical Alignments [4/5 sources]
- **Solstice alignments** are documented and accepted at multiple sites: Stonehenge (midsummer sunrise), Newgrange (midwinter sunrise), Maeshowe (midwinter sunset).
- **Lunar standstill alignments** (the 18.61-year cycle of the moon's declination extremes) were proposed by Thom at multiple sites including Callanish, Carnac, and Brodgar.
- Ruggles (1999) concluded that many of Thom's precise lunar alignments were not statistically supported, but that a general awareness of extreme lunar positions is plausible among megalith builders.
- Carnac rows: Proposed solar and lunar alignment along the Le Ménec axis (Thom & Thom, 1978) — debated; the rows' slight curvature and variable stone spacing complicate analysis.

### 2.3 Ritual-Processional Function [3/5 sources]
- Avenues connecting circles (Avebury → Sanctuary; Stonehenge → Avon) suggest **processional use** — movement between monuments as part of ceremony.
- Carnac rows interpreted by some as guiding pathways for ritual processions, with cromlechs serving as gathering/termination points.
- Evidence of feasting deposits, animal bone assemblages, and pottery at many henge sites supports communal ceremonial activity.

### 2.4 Maritime Megalithic Culture [3/5 sources]
- Distribution of megaliths along Atlantic coastlines (Portugal → Brittany → Britain → Ireland → Scandinavia) has led to hypotheses of a shared maritime tradition.
- Recent aDNA studies (Cassidy et al., 2020; Brace et al., 2019) confirm population connections along Atlantic seaboard in Neolithic period.
- Whether this constitutes a unified "culture" or independent parallel developments with some interaction is debated.

## 3. SPECULATIVE CLAIMS (Tier 3 — Possible but Unverified)

### 3.1 Electromagnetic and Geomagnetic Properties [2/5 sources]
- Some researchers have measured anomalous magnetic readings at stone circles, attributing significance to stone selection based on magnetic properties.
- Devereux's "Dragon Project" (1977–1987) measured radiation and ultrasound at stone sites; found variable but sometimes unusual readings.
- Not reproducibly confirmed; methodological criticism from mainstream geophysicists.

### 3.2 Carnac as Earthquake Predictor [1/5 sources]
- Pierre Méreaux-Tanguy (1992) proposed Carnac stones were positioned on seismic faults and functioned as earthquake detectors through piezoelectric effects in granite.
- Hypothesis is creative but unsupported by seismological or archaeological evidence.

### 3.3 Continental-Scale Sacred Geometry Network [2/5 sources]
- Some researchers claim straight lines connect distant megalithic sites across Europe, suggesting a master plan (→ O01).
- Statistical analyses show such alignments arise by chance when dealing with thousands of sites across a landscape (the "Texas sharpshooter" problem).

---

## 4. DUBIOUS CLAIMS (Tier 4 — No Credible Source)

### 4.1 Druidic Origin [0/5 sources]
- The association of stone circles with Druids (popularized by John Aubrey in 1649 and William Stukeley in the 1720s) is chronologically impossible: the megaliths predate the Iron Age Celtic culture by 2,000–3,000 years.
- Druids may have used existing monuments, but they did not build them.

### 4.2 Anti-Gravity / Lost Technology Construction [0/5 sources]
- Claims that advanced technology was needed to erect stones of 5–350 tonnes are contradicted by extensive experimental archaeology demonstrating feasibility with timber sledges, rollers, earthen ramps, and organized labor.
